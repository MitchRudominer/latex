\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.3} Suppose $a+b = c$. We need to show that $a=c-b$.
By Axiom (4) $b$ has a unique additive inverse $-b$. Adding $-b$
to both sides of the equation, and
using axioms (1), (2) and (3) we get
$a= a+0 = a + (b + (-b)) = (a+b) + (-b) = c + (-b) = c-b$.

Now suppose that $a-b = c$. We want to show that $a=b+c$.
Adding $b$ to both sides of the equation and using
the axioms we get
$a = a + 0 = a + (-b + b) = (a - b) +b  = c + b = b+c$.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.4} Fix integers $n,m$ and suppose that $n+m=n$.
We want to show that this implies that $m=0$.
By the previous exercise we  can subtract $n$ from both sides of the equation
to yield $m = n - n = 0$.


\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.5} Fix integers $n,m$ and suppose that $n+m=0$.
We want to show that this implies that $n=-m$ and $m=-n$.
By Exercise 2.3 we can subtract $m$ from both sides of the equation to yield
 $n = 0+ (-m) = -m$ . Similarly we can subtract $n$ from both sides of the
 equation to yield $m=0+(-n) = -n$.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.6} Since $0+0 = 0$, by the previous exercise
$0=-0$.


\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.7} Since $(-n) + n = 0$, by exercise 2.5,
$-(-n) = n$.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.9} Let $m=n\times 0$. To see that $m=0$, by
Excercise 2.4 it is enough to show that $n+m=n$.
$n+m = n + n\times 0 = n\times 1 + n\times 0
= n (1 + 0) = n \times 1 = n$.


\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.13} Fix integers integers $a, b$.
We want to show that $(-a)b = a(-b) = -(ab)$. Using Lemma 2.12
we see that all three of these expressions are equal to $-1(ab)$.
$(-a)b=(-1\cdot a)b = -1(ab)$, $a(-b)=a(-1\cdot b) = -1(ab)$,
$-(ab) = -1(ab)$.


\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.14} Let $m=n-1$. We need to show tht $m$ is
the predecessor of $n$. This means that $m<n$ and no integer lies between
$m$ and $n$. But this is true because $n=m+1$ so $n$ is the successor of $m$.


\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.16} We are asked to show that $1$ is the least
positive integer. This is true because $1=0+1$ so $1$ is the successor of 0,
meaning $0 < 1$ and there is no integer between 0 and 1. But this means
that 1 is positive and there is no positive integer less than 1.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.18} Let $S$ be the set of all positive real
numbers. This set does not have a minimal element.


\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.20} We are asked to show that Axiom (2) follows
from Lemma 2.19. So assume that Lemma 2.19 is true and we will prove
Axiom (2). Let $n$ be negative. We need to show that $-n$ is positive.
By Lemma 2.19 we can add $-n$ to both sides of the inequality $n < 0$ to get
$n-n < 0 -n$ or $0 < -n$. So $-n$ is positive.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.21} Suppose $n$ is positive. We will show $-n$
is negative. By Lemma 2.19 we can add $-n$ to both sides of the
ineqality $0<n$ to get $-n < n-n = 0$, so $-n$ is negative.


\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.24} This exercise was not in the right place.
It is more natural for this exercise to come after Exercise 2.29 because we
want to use Exercises 2.28 and 2.29 in the proof. Fix integers $a,b$.
We need to show that $\av{ab} = \av{a}\av{b}$. We consider several cases.
If $a=0$ or $b=0$ then both sides of the equation
$\av{ab} = \av{a}\av{b}$ equal zero. If $a>0$ and $b>0$ then both sides of
the equation $\av{ab} = \av{a}\av{b}$ equal $ab$. If $a$ is positive and
$b$ negative then, then by Exercise 2.29, $ab$ is negative and so
$\av{ab} = -(ab) = a (-b) = \av{a}\av{b}$. The proof is similar if
$a$ is negative and $b$ is positive.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.28} We are asked to show that the product of two
positive integers is positive. But this follows immediately from
Lemma  2.27 because if $a,b>0$ then $ab\geq a > 0$.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.29} We need to prove that the product of a
positive integer and a  negative integer is negative. Suppose that $a>0$
and $b<0$. Then $-b>0$. By the previous exercise $a(-b) > 0$ and so
$ab = -(a(-b)) < 0$.

Now we need to prove that the product of two negative integers is positive.
Suppose that $a,b<0$. Then $-a,-b > 0$ so $ab = 1\cdot ab = -1\cdot-1\cdot ab
=-a\cdot-b$ is positive.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.32} Let $a<b$ and $x>0$. We need to show
that $ax < bx$. By Lemma 2.25, $b-a$ is positive.
Since $x$ is also positive, we have $bx - ax = (b-a)x$,
which is the product of two positives and so is
positive. Thus by Lemma 2.24 again $ax < bx$.

Now, let $a<b$ and $x<0$. We need to show that $bx < ax$. By Lemma 2.25,
$b-a$ is positive. Since $x$ is negative we have $bx - ax = (b-a)x$, which
is the product of a positive and a negative and so is negative. Thus
$-(bx - ax) = (ax -bx)$ is positive. So $ax < bx$.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 2.33} Fix integers $n$ and $m$ with $n\not=0$.
Suppose $n\times m=n$. We need to show that $m=1$. This follows from
the Cancellation Law, Lemma 2.31. Since $m\times n = 1 \times n$ and $n\not=0$,
we can cancel $n$ to get $m=1$.

\bigskip


\textbf{Solution to Exercise 3.4}

\textbf{(a)} We are asked to show that
$a\divides b$ iff $-a\divides b$ iff $a\divides -b$. This follows from the
fact that $b=ac$ iff $b = (-a)(-c)$ iff $-b = a(-c)$.

\bigskip

\textbf{(b)}Suppse  $a\divides b \And a\divides c$. We must show that
$a\divides (b+c)$. Let $d$ and $e$ be such that $b=ad$ and $c=ae$.
Let $f=d+e$.
Then $b+c = ad + ae = a(d+e) =af$. So $a\divides (b+c)$.

\bigskip

\textbf{(c)} Suppose $a\divides b \And b\divides c$. We must show that
$a\divides c$. Let $d$ and $e$ be such that
$b=ad$ and $c=be$. Let f = $de$. Then $c=be=ade = af$. So $a\divides c$.

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 3.14}
\begin{itemize}
\item $17 \mod 100 = 17$
\item $100 \mod 17 = 15$
\item $-17 \bmod 100 = 83$
\item $-100 \bmod 17 = 2$
\item $27 \bmod 3 = 0$
\item $4 \bmod 3 = 1$
\item $3 \bmod 3 = 0$
\item $2 \bmod 3 = 2$
\item $1 \bmod 3 = 1$
\item $0 \bmod  = 0$
\item $-1 \bmod 3 = 2$
\item $-2 \bmod 3 = 1$
\item $-3 \bmod 3 = 0$
\item $-4 \bmod 3 = 2$
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 1.1 on page 4 of \emph{Shoup}}.
Let $a,b,d\in\Z$ with $d\not=0$. Show that $a\divides b$ if and only if
$da\divides db$.
\begin{proof}
Suppose $a\divides b$ and let $c$ be such that $b=ac$. Then $bd=adc$ so
$ad \divides bd$. Conversely suppose $ad \divides bd$ and let $c$ be
such that $bd = adc$. Since $d\not=0$ we can cancel it to yield
$b=ac$. So $a\divides b$.
\end{proof}

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 4.5} Suppose $I_1$ and $I_2$ are ideals. Show that $I_1 \intersect I_2$ is an ideal.
\begin{proof}
We must show that  $I_1 \intersect I_2$  satisfies the the three clauses in the definition of an ideal:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is non-empty.
\item It is closed under addition.
\item It is closed under scalar multiplication.
\end{itemize}
Since 0 is in both $I_1$ and $I_2$, 0 is in  $I_1 \intersect I_2$ and so  $I_1 \intersect I_2$  is non-empty.
To see that $I_1 \intersect I_2$ is closed under addition, let $a, b\in I_1 \intersect I_2$ and we will show that $a+b\in  I_1 \intersect I_2$.
Since  $a, b\in I_1 \intersect I_2$,  $a, b\in I_1$. Since $I_1$ is an ideal, $a+b\in I_1$. By the same argument $a+b\in I_2$.
So $a+b\in I_1\intersect I_2$.

To see that $I_1 \intersect I_2$ is closed under scalar multiplication, let $a \in I_1 \intersect I_2$ and let $x\in\Z$ and we will show that $xa\in  I_1 \intersect I_2$.
Since  $a\in I_1 \intersect I_2$,  $a\in I_1$. Since $I_1$ is an ideal, $xa\in I_1$. By the same argument $xa\in I_2$.
So $xa\in I_1\intersect I_2$.
\end{proof}

Now suppose that $\cS$ is a non-empty collection of ideals. Prove that the intersection
of all ideals in $\cS$ is also an ideal.

\begin{proof}
This proof is very similar to the previous one except it is a little more abstract because rather than having two ideals $I_1$ and $I_2$ we now have
a set $\cS$ of ideals. In order to follow this proof, think about the fact that if $\cS = \singleton{I_1, I_2}$ then this proof reduces to the previous proof.

Let $I$ be the intersection of all ideals in $\cS$. To see that $I$ is an ideal we must show that it is non-empty, closed under addition, and closed under scalar multiplication. It is non-empty because $0\in I$ because 0 is in every ideal in $\cS$. Let $a, b \in I$. Then $a$ and $b$ are in every ideal in $\cS$ so $a+b$ is in every ideal in $\cS$ so $a+b\in I$. Let $a\in I$ and $x\in\Z$. Then $a$ is in every ideal in $\cS$ so $xa$ is in every ideal in $\cS$ so $xa\in I$.
\end{proof}

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 4.8} Show that $a\Z$ is an ideal of $\Z$ that contains $a$.
\begin{proof}
$a\Z$ contains $a$ because $a=1\cdot a$ is a multiple of $a$. Thus $a\Z$ is not empty. To see that $a\Z$ is closed under addition, note that
$xa + ya = (x+y)a$ so that the sum of two multiples of $a$ is again a multiple of $a$. To see that $a\Z$ is closed under scalar multiplication,
note that $y(xa) = (yx)a$ so that a scalar multiple of a multiple of $a$ is also a multiple of $a$.
\end{proof}

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 4.10}  Note that we will use Lemma 4.9 so we know that $(a) = a\Z$.

$b\in (a)$ iff $a\divides b$.
\begin{proof}
This is easy because $b\in (a)$ iff $b\in a\Z$ iff $b$ is a multiple of $a$ iff $a\divides b$.
\end{proof}

For any ideal $I$, $b\in I$ iff $(b)\subseteq I$.
\begin{proof}
If $(b)\subseteq I$ then obviously $b\in I$. For the other direction, suppose $b\in I$. The reason we get $(b)\subseteq I$ is that $I$ is closed under scalar multiplication and so every multiple of $b$ is also in $I$.
\end{proof}

$(b)\subseteq (a)$ iff $a\divides b$.
\begin{proof}
If $(b)\subseteq (a)$ then $b\in (a)$ so $a\divides b$ by the first part of this exercise. If $a\divides b$ then $b\in (a)$ so by the second part of
this exercise $(b)\subseteq (a)$.
\end{proof}

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 4.12}  Show that $I_1+I_2$ is an ideal.
\begin{proof}
Let $I=I_1+I_2$. $0\in I$ because $0=0+0$. So $I$ is not empty. To see that $I$ is closed under addition,
let $a,b\in I$. Then there are $a_1,b_1\in I_1$ and $a_2,b_2\in I_2$ such that $a=a_1+a_2$ and $b=b_1+b_2$.
Then $a+b = (a_1+b_1) + (a_2 + b_2)$ and $(a_1+b_1)\in I_1$ and $(a_2+b_2)\in I_2$ so $a+b\in I$.
To see that $I$ is closed under scalar multiplication, let $a=a_1+a_2$ be as above and let $x\in\Z$.
Then $xa=xa_1+xa_2\in I$.
\end{proof}

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 4.13}  Let $(a)$ and $(b)$ be two principal ideals. Show that $(a)+(b)$ is equal to the set of all integer linear combinations of $a$ and $b$.
\begin{proof}
This follows just by unravelling definitions. An element of $(a)+(b)$ looks like $xa+yb$ for some $x,y\in\Z$.
But this is exactly an integer linear combination of $a$ and $b$ by definition.
\end{proof}

\bigskip

\textbf{Solution to Exercise 4.15}  Show that $(a,b)=(a)+(b)$.
\begin{proof}
$(a)+(b)$ is an ideal that contains $a$ and $b$ so $(a,b)\subseteq(a)+(b)$. By Lemma 4.3 every ideal
is closed under integer linear combinations, so $(a,b)$ contains all integer linear combinations of $a$ and $b$
so by the previous exercise $(a)+(b)\subseteq (a,b)$.
\end{proof}
