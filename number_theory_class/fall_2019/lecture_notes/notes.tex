\section{What is this class about?}

Elementary number theory is the theory of the integers.

$\Z = \singleton{\cdots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots} = $ the set of \emph{integers}.

Here is a quick peek at some ideas we will learn in this class. We'll zip through this quickly. Don't
worry if you don't fully understand it yet. We'll cover this carefully later on. Here I'm just trying
to give you a flavor of the material you will learn in this class.

Let $\Z_n$ be the integers mod n.

For example $\Z_{10} = \singleton{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$ under addition and multiplication $\mod 10.$ This means for example that in $Z_{10}$,
$6 \times 7 = 2$ because $42 \mod 10 = 2$, and $4 + 9 = 3$ because $13 \mod 10 = 3$.
(Here $x \mod n$ means the remainder upon diving $x$ by $n$.)

In $\Z_{10}$ notice that some numbers have multiplicative inverses and some do not. For
example in $\Z_{10}, 3 \times 7 = 1$ so $3$ and $7$ are multiplicative inverses. But $4$ does not have any
multiplicative inverse in $\Z_{10}$ because the multiples of $4$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $4, 8, 2, 6, 0$.

If an element of $\Z_{10}$ has an inverse then it is called a unit. The set of all units of
$\Z_{10}$ is written $\Z^*_{10}$. You can check that
$\Z^*_{10} = \singleton{1,3,7,9}$.

You can check that $\Z^*_{10}$ is closed under multiplication. That is, in $\Z_{10}$, if
$a,b$ are units then so is $ab$. For example 3 and 9 are units and in $Z_{10}$, $3\times 9 = 7$
and $7$ is a unit. So if you take any $a\in \Z^*_{10}$, then all of the powers of $a$, $a^n$, are
also in $\Z^*_{10}$.

Consider the powers of $9$ in $\Z^*_{10}$. $9^2=1, 9^3 = 9, 9^4 =1, 9^5 = 9, \cdots$. So the only
powers of $9$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $9$ and $1$.

Now consider the powers of $3$ in $\Z^*_{10}$. $3^2=9, 3^3 = 7, 3^4 =1, 3^5 = 9, 3^6 = 7, \cdots$.
So the powers of $3$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $\singleton{1,3,7,9}$, i.e. all of $\Z^*_{10}$. We say
that $3$ is a generator of $\Z^*_{10}$ and that 3 is a \emph{primitive root} of 10. As we saw above,
9 is not a primitive root of 10.

Now let's play that whole game with $\Z_8$ instead of $\Z_{10}$.
$\Z_8 = \singleton{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}$ under addition and multiplication $\mod 8$.
$\Z^*_{8} = \singleton{1,3,5,7}$. Notice that $1^2 = 1, 3^2 = 1, 5^2 = 1, 7^2 = 1$. This means
that none of $\singleton{1,3,5,7}$ is a generator of $\Z^*_{8}$. $Z^*_{8}$ does not have any
generators. 8 does not have any primitive roots.

Which integers have primitive roots? With effort you could check the following:
3 yes, 4 yes, 5 yes, 6 yes, 7 yes, 8 no, 9 yes, 10 yes, 11 yes, 12 no, 13 yes, 14 yes, 15 no,
16 no, 17 yes, 18 yes, 19 yes 20 no.

What's going on here? What is the pattern of which integers have primitive roots? After taking
 this
class, you will have a full and deep understanding of this question.

\section{Axioms for the Integers}

\textbf{Question} Find the prime factorization of 20.

\textbf{Answer} $20=2^2 \times 5$?

\textbf{Question} Is this the only prime factorization of 20?

\textbf{Answer} Yes.

\textbf{Question} Find the prime factorization of 54.

\textbf{Answer} $54=2\times 3^3$?

\textbf{Question} Is this the only prime factorization of 54?

\textbf{Answer} Yes.

\begin{theorem}[The Fundamental Theorem Of Arithmetic] For all integers $n>1$, $n$ may be expressed as
a product of primes: $n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, and this expression is unique
up to reordering of the primes.
\end{theorem}

Our first major goal of the course will be to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Think about how you would prove it.

One problem that arises immediately is this: The fact that you can factor integers into prime numbers is something we learn
early in school. If we are going to prove this fact then obviously we are not allowed to assume this fact. But this is
one of the ``basic" facts about the integers. If we are not allowed to assume this basic fact then which other basic facts
are we not allowed to assume? If we don't know what we are allowed to assume, then how could we possibly prove anything?

To resolve this problem we will write down exactly what it is we are planning to assume about the integers. Everything else in
this course will be derived from these axioms.

\subsection{Axioms Of Order}
The order $<$ on $\Z$ is a discrete linear order without endpoints such that every segment bounded below is well-founded.
In more detail this means:

\begin{enumerate}
\item transitive: $\forall n,m,p \in \Z, n < m \And m < p \Implies n < p$
\item asymmetric: $\forall n,m \in \Z, n < m \Implies m \not< n$.
\item connected: $\forall n,m \in \Z, n\not=m \Implies (n < m \Or m < n)$
\item successors and predecessors: \\
$(\forall b, \exists a,c) \left\{ a < b < c \And (\forall x )
\left [ \neg (a < x < b) \And \neg (b < x < c) \right] \right \}$.
\item quasi-well-founded: Let $A\subset \Z, A\not=\emptyset,A $
bounded below (i.e. $\exists n\in \Z, \forall m\in A, n < m$.) Then $A$ has a least element.
\end{enumerate}

Axiom (5) may sound circular but it is not. The point to keep in mind is that $n$ is not in $A$ so
$n$ is not the least element of $A$ so the assertion that $A$ has some least element is not vacuous.
To see that Axiom (5) is not circular, the following exercise asks you to show that Axiom (5) is not true
if we replace the integers with the real numbers.

\begin{homework}
Show that Axiom (5) is not true of the real numbers. Give a set $A\subset\R$ such that $A\not=\emptyset$,
$A$ is bounded below, but $A$ does not have a least element.
\end{homework}

\begin{homework}
Explain why the ``bounded below" hypothesis is necessary. Give a non-empty subset of $\Z$ that is not bounded
below and does not have a least element.
\end{homework}

The primary instance of Axiom (5) we will use is:

\begin{remark}
Let $A$ be a non-empty set of positive integers. Then $A$ has a least element.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
This follows from Axiom (5) because every set of positive integers is bounded below (by 0).
\end{proof}
