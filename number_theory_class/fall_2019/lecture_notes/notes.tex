\section{What is this class about?}

Elementary number theory is the theory of the integers.

$\Z = \singleton{\cdots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots} = $ the set of \emph{integers}.

Here is a quick peek at some ideas we will learn in this class. We'll zip through this quickly. Don't
worry if you don't fully understand it yet. We'll cover this carefully later on. Here I'm just trying
to give you a flavor of the material you will learn in this class.

Let $\Z_n$ be the integers mod n.

For example $\Z_{10} = \singleton{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$ under addition and multiplication $\mod 10.$ This means for example that in $Z_{10}$,
$6 \times 7 = 2$ because $42 \mod 10 = 2$, and $4 + 9 = 3$ because $13 \mod 10 = 3$.
(Here $x \mod n$ means the remainder upon diving $x$ by $n$.)

In $\Z_{10}$ notice that some numbers have multiplicative inverses and some do not. For
example in $\Z_{10}, 3 \times 7 = 1$ so $3$ and $7$ are multiplicative inverses. But $4$ does not have any
multiplicative inverse in $\Z_{10}$ because the multiples of $4$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $4, 8, 2, 6, 0$.

If an element of $\Z_{10}$ has an inverse then it is called a unit. The set of all units of
$\Z_{10}$ is written $\Z^*_{10}$. You can check that
$\Z^*_{10} = \singleton{1,3,7,9}$.

You can check that $\Z^*_{10}$ is closed under multiplication. That is, in $\Z_{10}$, if
$a,b$ are units then so is $ab$. For example 3 and 9 are units and in $Z_{10}$, $3\times 9 = 7$
and $7$ is a unit. So if you take any $a\in \Z^*_{10}$, then all of the powers of $a$, $a^n$, are
also in $\Z^*_{10}$.

Consider the powers of $9$ in $\Z^*_{10}$. $9^2=1, 9^3 = 9, 9^4 =1, 9^5 = 9, \cdots$. So the only
powers of $9$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $9$ and $1$.

Now consider the powers of $3$ in $\Z^*_{10}$. $3^2=9, 3^3 = 7, 3^4 =1, 3^5 = 9, 3^6 = 7, \cdots$.
So the powers of $3$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $\singleton{1,3,7,9}$, i.e. all of $\Z^*_{10}$. We say
that $3$ is a generator of $\Z^*_{10}$ and that 3 is a \emph{primitive root} of 10.

Now let's play that whole game with $\Z_8$ instead of $\Z_{10}$.
$\Z_8 = \singleton{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}$ under addition and multiplication $\mod 8$.
$\Z^*_{8} = \singleton{1,3,5,7}$. Notice that $1^2 = 1, 3^2 = 1, 5^2 = 1, 7^2 = 1$. This means
that none of $\singleton{1,3,5,7}$ is a generator of $\Z^*_{8}$. $Z^*_{8}$ does not have any
generators. 8 does not have any primitive roots.

Which integers have primitive roots? With effort you could check the following:
3 yes, 4 yes, 5 yes, 6 yes, 7 yes, 8 no, 9 yes, 10 yes, 11 yes, 12 no, 13 yes, 14 yes, 15 no,
16 no, 17 yes, 18 yes, 19 yes 20 no.

What's going on here? What is the logic behind which integers have primitive roots. After taking
 this
class, you will have a full and deep understanding of this question.
