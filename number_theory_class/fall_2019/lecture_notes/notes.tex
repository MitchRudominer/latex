\section{What is this class about?}

Elementary number theory is the theory of the integers.

$\Z = \singleton{\cdots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \cdots} = $ the set of \emph{integers}.

Here is a quick peek at some ideas we will learn in this class. We'll zip through this quickly. Don't
worry if you don't fully understand it yet. We'll cover this carefully later on. Here I'm just trying
to give you a flavor of the material you will learn in this class.

Let $\Z_n$ be the integers mod n.

For example $\Z_{10} = \singleton{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$ under addition and multiplication $\mod 10.$ This means for example that in $Z_{10}$,
$6 \times 7 = 2$ because $42 \mod 10 = 2$, and $4 + 9 = 3$ because $13 \mod 10 = 3$.
(Here $x \mod n$ means the remainder upon diving $x$ by $n$.)

In $\Z_{10}$ notice that some numbers have multiplicative inverses and some do not. For
example in $\Z_{10}, 3 \times 7 = 1$ so $3$ and $7$ are multiplicative inverses. But $4$ does not have any
multiplicative inverse in $\Z_{10}$ because the multiples of $4$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $4, 8, 2, 6, 0$.

If an element of $\Z_{10}$ has an inverse then it is called a unit. The set of all units of
$\Z_{10}$ is written $\Z^*_{10}$. You can check that
$\Z^*_{10} = \singleton{1,3,7,9}$.

You can check that $\Z^*_{10}$ is closed under multiplication. That is, in $\Z_{10}$, if
$a,b$ are units then so is $ab$. For example 3 and 9 are units and in $Z_{10}$, $3\times 9 = 7$
and $7$ is a unit. So if you take any $a\in \Z^*_{10}$, then all of the powers of $a$, $a^n$, are
also in $\Z^*_{10}$.

Consider the powers of $9$ in $\Z^*_{10}$. $9^2=1, 9^3 = 9, 9^4 =1, 9^5 = 9, \cdots$. So the only
powers of $9$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $9$ and $1$.

Now consider the powers of $3$ in $\Z^*_{10}$. $3^2=9, 3^3 = 7, 3^4 =1, 3^5 = 9, 3^6 = 7, \cdots$.
So the powers of $3$ in $\Z_{10}$ are $\singleton{1,3,7,9}$, i.e. all of $\Z^*_{10}$. We say
that $3$ is a generator of $\Z^*_{10}$ and that 3 is a \emph{primitive root} of 10. As we saw above,
9 is not a primitive root of 10.

Now let's play that whole game with $\Z_8$ instead of $\Z_{10}$.
$\Z_8 = \singleton{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}$ under addition and multiplication $\mod 8$.
$\Z^*_{8} = \singleton{1,3,5,7}$. Notice that $1^2 = 1, 3^2 = 1, 5^2 = 1, 7^2 = 1$. This means
that none of $\singleton{1,3,5,7}$ is a generator of $\Z^*_{8}$. $Z^*_{8}$ does not have any
generators. 8 does not have any primitive roots.

Which integers have primitive roots? With effort you could check the following:
3 yes, 4 yes, 5 yes, 6 yes, 7 yes, 8 no, 9 yes, 10 yes, 11 yes, 12 no, 13 yes, 14 yes, 15 no,
16 no, 17 yes, 18 yes, 19 yes 20 no.

What's going on here? What is the pattern of which integers have primitive roots? After taking
 this
class, you will have a full and deep understanding of this question.

\section{Axioms for the Integers}

\textbf{Question} Find the prime factorization of 20.

\textbf{Answer} $20=2^2 \times 5$?

\textbf{Question} Is this the only prime factorization of 20?

\textbf{Answer} Yes.

\textbf{Question} Find the prime factorization of 54.

\textbf{Answer} $54=2\times 3^3$?

\textbf{Question} Is this the only prime factorization of 54?

\textbf{Answer} Yes.

\begin{theorem}[The Fundamental Theorem Of Arithmetic] For all integers $n>1$, $n$ may be expressed
as a product of powers of primes: $n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where each
$p_i$ is a prime number and each $e_i\geq 1$. This expression is unique up to the order of
the primes.
\end{theorem}

Our first major goal of the course will be to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Think
for a moment about how you would prove it yourself.

One problem that arises immediately is this: The fact that you can factor integers into prime numbers is something we learn
early in school. If we are going to prove this fact then obviously we are not allowed to assume this fact. But this is
one of the ``basic" facts about the integers. If we are not allowed to assume this basic fact then which other basic facts
are we not allowed to assume? If we don't know what we are allowed to assume, then how could we possibly prove anything?

To resolve this problem we will write down exactly what it is we are planning to assume about the integers. We will call these assumptions the Axioms of the Integers. Everything else in
this course will be derived from these axioms.

\subsection{Axioms about addition}
The integers form an abelian group under addition.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $+$ is associative: $\forall n,m,k\in\Z, (n+m)+k=n+(m+k)$
\item $+$ is commutative: $\forall n,m\in\Z, n+m=m+n$
\item 0 is an additive identity: $\forall n\in\Z, n+0 = 0+n = n$
\item Every integer has an additive inverse: For all integers $n$ there exists another
integer called $-n$ such that $n + (-n) = (-n) + n = 0$.
\end{enumerate}

We write $a-b$ instead of $a + (-b)$.

\subsection{Axioms about multiplication}
The integers form a commutative ring under addition and multiplication.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\times$ is associative: $\forall n,m,k\in\Z, (n\times m )\times k = n \times (m \times k)$
\item $\times$ is commutative: $\forall n,m\in\Z, n\times m = m\times n$
\item 1 is a multiplicative identity: $\forall n\not= 0, n\times 1 = n$
\item $\times$ distributes over $+$: $\forall n,m,k\in\Z, n\times(m+k) = (n\times m) + (n\times k)$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
Notice that there are additive inverses but not multiplicative inverses.
\end{remark}

We use several other notations besides $\times$ to indicate multiplication.
All of the following can mean $a\times b: a*b, a\cdot b, ab$.
Multiplication has higher order of precedence than addition in an expression so
that $ab+cd$ means $(a\times b) + (c\times d)$ and not $a(b+c)d$.

\subsection{Axioms of linear order}
$(\Z, <)$ is a discrete linear order in which $n+1$ is the successor of $n$ and
$n-1$ is the predecessor of $n$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $<$ is transitive: $\forall n,m,p \in \Z, n < m \And m < p \Implies n < p$
\item $<$ is asymmetric: $\forall n,m \in \Z, n < m \Implies m \not< n$.
\item $<$ is connected: $\forall n,m \in \Z, n\not=m \Implies (n < m \Or m < n)$
\item For all integers $n$, $n+1$ is the successor of $n$, i.e. the least integer greater than $n$.
That is, $n<n+1$ and there is no $m$ such that $n < m < n+1$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
It follows from (4) that $n-1$ is the predecessor of $n$, i.e. the greatest integer
less than $n$.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
If $n>0$ we say that $n$ is positive and if $n<0$ we say that $n$ is negative.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Axiom of wellordering}
The set of positive integers is wellorderd by $<$ and the negative numbers are the
reflection of the positive numbers.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every non-empty set of positive integers contains a least element.
\item If $n$ is negative then $-n$ is positive.
\end{enumerate}

Axiom (1) allows us to use proof by induction on the positive integers.
\begin{lemma}[Proof by induction] Let P be any property of integers. Suppose
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $P(1)$, and
\item For all $n>0$, $P(n) \Implies P(n+1)$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $P(n)$ holds for all positive integers.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be the set of positive integers for which $P$ does not hold. We will show that
$S$ is empty. Suppose $S$ is not empty and we will derive a contradiction.
By axiom (1), $S$ has a least element, $m$. By (i), $m\not=1$ so $m=n+1$ for
some positive integer $n$. Since $n<m$ and $m$ is the least positive integer in $S$,
$n\notin S$. So $P(n)$ holds. By (ii), $P(n+1)$ holds. So $m\notin S$. Contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{homework}
Show that the set of positive \emph{real} numbers is not wellordered by $<$.
Give a non-empty set of positive real numbers that does not contain a least element.
\end{homework}


\begin{lemma}
If $n$ is positive then $-n$ is negative.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We prove by induction that for all $n>0$, $-n<0$. This is true for $n=1$ since $-1$ is the
predecessor of 0. Suppose it is true for $n$ and we will show it is true for $n+1$.
We need to show that $-(n+1) < 0$. But $-(n+1) = -n -1$ is the predecessor of $-n$ so
$-(n+1) < -n < 0$.
\end{proof}
