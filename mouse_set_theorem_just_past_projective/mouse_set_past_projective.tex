\begin{abstract}
We will describe a natural mouse $M$ and show that $\R\intersect M = Q_{\omega+1}$
where $Q_{\omega+1}$  is the set of reals that are
$\Delta^1_{\omega+1}$ in a countable ordinal. Thus $Q_{\omega+1}$
is a mouse set.

This is analogous to the fact that $\R\intersect M_1 = Q_3$ where $M_1$ is the
canonical inner model with a Woodin cardinal, and $Q_3$ is the set of reals
that are $\Delta^1_3$ in a countable ordinal.

More generally $\R\intersect M_{2n+1} = Q_{2n+3}$.
The pointclass $\Delta_{\omega+1}$  we consider in this paper is the next natural
pointclass to consider in this series of results. It is the analogue of
the $\Delta^1_{2n+3}$ just past projective. Thus we are proving the mouse
set theorem just past projective.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}

We work in $\ZFC+\AD(\LofR)$ for convenience. We need much less determinacy
than this, just a bit past $\PD$.

Throughout this paper we write $\R$ to mean $\Bairespace$ and we call elements of $\Bairespace$ \emph{reals}.

\section{Project-like Pointclasses Just Past Projective}
\label{section:projectlikepointclasses}

\begin{definition}
Let $\PiOneOmega$ be the pointclass of recursive intersections of infinitely many (lightface) projective sets.

In more detail, fix for the remainder of this paper, for $n\in\omega$, $G^n\subset\omega\times\R$
a universal $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$ set, uniformly in $n$.
A $\PiOneOmega$ \emph{code} is a total recursive function $h:\omega\to\omega$. If $h$ is a $\PiOneOmega$ code then
$A^h=\setof{x\in\R}{(\forall n)\, G^n(h(n),x)}$. Say $A\subseteq\R$ is $\PiOneOmega$ iff
$A=A^h$ for some $\PiOneOmega$ code $h$.

Similarly we define $\PiOneOmega$ subsets of $\omega^s\times \R^t$ for $s,t\in\omega$.

Then we define $\SigmaOneOmega = \neg\PiOneOmega$, $\SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne=\exists^{\R}\PiOneOmega$,
$\PiOneOmegaPlusOne = \forall^{\R}\SigmaOneOmega$ and
$\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne = \SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne \intersect \PiOneOmegaPlusOne$.

Finally we define as usual the relativized and bold-face
pointclasses $\PiOneOmega(x)$
and $\bPi^1_{\omega}$ etc.
\end{definition}

The following remarks follow from \cite{Scales_In_LofR}.
\begin{remarks} \
\begin{itemize}
\item $\SigmaOneOmega = \Sigma_1(\JofR{2}) \intersect \Powerset(\R)$
\item $\PiOneOmega = \Pi_1(\JofR{2}) \intersect \Powerset(\R)$
\item $\SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne = \Sigma_2(\JofR{2}) \intersect \Powerset(\R)$
\item $\PiOneOmegaPlusOne = \Pi_2(\JofR{2}) \intersect \Powerset(\R)$
\item $\SigmaOneOmega$ and $\PiOneOmegaPlusOne$
are scaled pointclasses.
(Recall we are assuming $\AD(\LofR)$. $\Det(\JofR{3})$ suffices here. )
\end{itemize}
\end{remarks}


\begin{definition}
We say that $x\in\R$ is $\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne$ in a countable ordinal iff there is an $\alpha<\omega_1$ such
that for all $w\in\WO$ with $|w|=\alpha$, $\singleton{x}$ is $\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne(w)$.
Let $Q_{\omega+1} = \setof{x\in\R}{x\text{ is }\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne\text{ in a countable ordinal}}$.
\end{definition}

By way of intuition, we consider $\PiOneOmegaPlusOne$ to be analogous to
$\Pi^1_1$ or $\Pi^1_3$ and we consider $Q_{\omega+1}$ to be analogous to
$Q_1$ or $Q_3$. See \cite{Q_Theory}.

Recall that $Q_3 = \R \intersect M_1^{\sharp}$. In the next section we will
define a mouse $\Mladder$ such that $Q_{\omega+1} = \R\intersect\Mladder$.

\begin{remarks} \
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x\in Q_{\omega+1}$ iff there is a $\SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne$ relation $R$ and
a countable ordinal $\alpha$ such that for all $w\in\WO$ with $|w|=\alpha$,
and for all reals $y$, $R(w,y) \Iff y=x$.
\item $x\in Q_{\omega+1}$ iff there is a $\SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne$ relation $R$
and a countable ordinal $\alpha$ such
that for all $w\in\WO$ with $|w|=\alpha$, and all $i,j\in\omega$,
$x(i)=j \Iff R(w,i,j)$.
\item $Q_{\omega+1}$ is the largest countable
$\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne$ set closed downwards under
$\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne$-degrees.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks}


\section{Ladder Mice}
\label{section:laddermice}
\begin{definition}
Let $M$ be a premouse, in the sense of \cite{FSIT}. A \emph{ladder over $M$}
is a sequence of ordinals $\sequence{\delta_n,\gamma_n}{n\in\omega}$ such that
for all $n$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta_n < \gamma_n < \delta_{n+1} < \ord(M)$,
\item $\delta_n$ is a cardinal of $M$,
\item $\delta_n$ is Woodin in $J^M_{\gamma_n}$,
\item $\gamma_n$ is the least $\gamma$ such that $\cJ^M_{\gamma}$ is active and
$\cJ^M_{\gamma}\models$ there are $n$ Woodin cardinals greater than $\delta_n$.
\end{enumerate}

A ladder $\sequence{\delta_n,\gamma_n}{n\in\omega}$ over $M$ is \emph{cofinal}
iff the $\gamma_n$ are cofinal in $\ord(M)$.

$M$ is a \emph{ladder mouse} iff there is a ladder over $M$ and a
\emph{cofinal ladder mouse} iff there is a cofinal ladder over $M$.

$M$ is a \emph{minimal ladder mouse} iff $M$ is a ladder mouse but no initial
segment of $M$ is.

$\Mladder$ is the least fully-iterable ladder mouse, if it exists. If
$\Mladder$ exists it is obviously a minimal ladder mouse (and so a cofinal
ladder mouse), and $\Mladder$ projects to $\omega$ and so it is an $\omega$-mouse
in the sense of \cite{Proj_WO_In_Mod}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remarks} \
\begin{enumerate}
\item Because we are assuming $\AD(\LofR)$, $\Mladder$ exists.
\item For every $n\in\omega$, $\Mladder$ has a rank initial segment that satisfies
$\ZFC$+$\exists n$ Woodin cardinals.  By \cite{Proj_WO_In_Mod}, $\Mladder$ is projectively correct and so $\PiOneOmega$-correct.
\item Let $\sequence{\delta_n,\gamma_n}{n\in\omega}$ be a ladder over $\Mladder$.
For even $n$, $J^{\Mladder}_{\gamma_n}[g]$ is $\Sigma^1_{n+2}$-correct,
where $g$ is $J^{\Mladder}_{\gamma_n}$-generic over $\Coll(\omega,\delta_n)$.
\item Let $\sequence{\delta_n,\gamma_n}{n\in\omega}$ be a ladder over $M$.
$\delta_n$ is not necessarily fully Woodin in $M$, but $\delta_n$ is Woodin in $M$
with respect to functions in $J^M_{\gamma_n}$.
\item By the previous two items, we can, at lest informally, think of
$\Mladder$ as the least mouse
$M$ such that for every $n\in\omega$ there is a cardinal $\delta$ of $M$ such
that $\delta$ is ``$\Sigma^1_n$-Woodin'' in $M$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remarks}

We can now state the main theorem of the paper:

\begin{theorem}
$Q_{\omega+1} = \R \intersect \Mladder$.
\end{theorem}

We divide the above theorem up into its two directions:

\begin{theorem}
\label{MRealsAreDefinable}
$\R \intersect \Mladder \subseteq Q_{\omega+1}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\label{DefinableRealsAreInM}
$Q_{\omega+1} \subseteq \Mladder$.
\end{theorem}

Theorem \ref{MRealsAreDefinable} was proven more than 25 years ago in
\cite{My_Thesis} and \cite{Mouse_Sets}. We give a sketch of the proof later
in section \ref{ProofThatMRealsAreDefinable}. The proof follows the same
line of reasoning as the proof that every real in $L$ is $\Delta^1_2$ in a
countable ordinal and the proof that every real in $M_1$ is $\Delta^1_3$ in
a countable ordinal. Namely we show that every initial segment of $\Mladder$
that projects to $\omega$ is $\PiOneOmega$ definable from its ordinal height.

But 25 years ago the first author was not able to prove Theorem \ref{DefinableRealsAreInM}.
That was proven in the summer of 2019 by Woodin, and giving that proof is the
main goal of this paper.

Theorem \ref{DefinableRealsAreInM} will follow from a quasi-correctness theorem
for $\Mladder$. $\Mladder$ is $\PiOneOmega$-correct but not $\SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne$-correct.
Let $A\subset\R^2$ be $\PiOneOmega$ and let $x\in\R\intersect\Mladder$. It may
happen that there is a $y\in \R$ such that $A(x,y)$ but there is no such $y$
in $\Mladder$. But we will show that even if $\Mladder\not\models(\exists y) A(x,y)$,
$\Mladder$ can still determine whether or not the statement
``$(\exists y) A(x,y)$'' is true. This is similar to the situation with $M_1$ and
$\Sigma^1_3$. $M_1$ is not $\Sigma^1_3$-correct, but $M_1$ can still tell whether
or not $\Sigma^1_3$ statements are true. Let $A\subset\R^2$ be $\Pi^1_2$ and
let $x\in M_1$. Then $(\exists y\in\R)\, A(x,y)$ iff
$$M_1\models 1\force{\Coll(\omega,\delta)} (\exists y) A(x,y),$$
where $\delta$ is the Woodin of $M_1$.

Next we state the
$\SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne$-quasi-correctness for $\Mladder$ precisely and
we show how
Theorem \ref{DefinableRealsAreInM} follows from it.

If $z$ is a real, then by a \emph{mouse over $z$} we mean a mouse in the
sense of the theory of \cite{FSIT} augmented to use $z$ as an additional predicate.

\begin{theorem}
\label{QuasiCorrectness}
There is a formula $\psi$ in the language of Set Theory such that, for all
reals $z$, for all $M$ a countable, iterable, ladder-mouse over $z$,
for all reals $x$ in $M$,
for all $\PiOneOmega$ codes $h$,
$$(\exists y) A^h(x,y) \Iff J^M_{\omega_2^M} \models \psi[h,x].$$
\end{theorem}

Now, assuming Theorem \ref{QuasiCorrectness}, we prove Theorem \ref{DefinableRealsAreInM}.

\begin{proof}[proof of Theorem \ref{DefinableRealsAreInM}]
Let $x\in Q_{\omega+1}$. We need to show that $x\in\Mladder$.
Fix a $\PiOneOmega$ code $h$ and a countable ordinal $\alpha$ such that for
all $w\in\WO$ with $|w|=\alpha$, and all $i,j\in\omega$,
$$x(i)=j \Iff (\exists y\in\R)A^h(i,j,w,y).$$
Let $\Mprime$ be the $(\alpha+1)$-th iterate of $\Mladder$ by its least
measurable cardinal. So $\Mprime$ is a countable, iterable ladder mouse with
a ladder whose $\delta_0$ is greater than $\alpha$. Let $g$ be $\Mprime$-generic
for $\Coll(\omega,\alpha$). It suffices to see that $x\in\Mprime[g]$.

We can rearrange $\Mprime[g]$ as a mouse over $z$, where $z$ is some real coding $g$.
Let $M$ be this mouse over $z$. $M$ is a countable, iterable ladder-mouse over $z$ and there
is a real $w\in M\intersect\WO$ with $|w|=\alpha$.

Let $\psi$ be the formula given by Theorem \ref{QuasiCorrectness}. Then for all
$i,j\in\omega$,
$$x(i)=j \Iff (\exists y\in\R)A^h(i,j,w,y) \Iff J^M_{\omega_2^M} \models \psi[h,i,j,w].$$
So $x\in M$.
\end{proof}


We now develop the ideas that will allow us to prove theorem \ref{QuasiCorrectness}. We
start in the next section with a Suslin representation for $\PiOneOmega$ sets.

\section{A Suslin Representation for $\PiOneOmega$}
\label{section:suslinrep}

Let $\bdelta^1_{\omega} = \sup_n \bdelta^1_n$. In this section we show how to
express a $\PiOneOmega$ set as the projection
of a tree on $\omega\times \bdelta^1_{\omega}$.

\begin{definition}
Let $h$ be a $\PiOneOmega$ code for a subset of $\R$.
There is a natural tree $T^{h}$ on $\omega\times\bdelta^1_{\omega}$ that projects to $A^h$.

Recall that $G^n\subset\omega\times\R$ is a universal $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$ set, uniformly in $n$.

For $n,e\in\omega$, let $G^n_e = \setof{x\in\R}{G^n(e, x)}$ and
let $\varphi^n_e = \sequence{\varphi^n_{e,i}}{i\in\omega}$ be a $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$ scale on $G^n_e$ uniformly in $n$ and $e$,
with each of the norms $\varphi^n_{e,i}$ being regular.
Let $<^n_{e,i}$ be the prewellorder on $\R$ associated with $\varphi^n_{e,i}$. So ``$x,y\in G^n_e$ and $x <^n_{e,i} y$'' is
$\Pi^1_{2n+1}$, uniformly in $n,e,i$, and $\varphi^n_{e,i}(x) = $ the rank of $x$ in $<^n_{e,i}$.
$\varphi^n_{e,i} : G^n_e \map \bdelta^1_{2n+1}$.

Let $T^n_e$ be the tree for the scale $\varphi^n_e$. So
$$[T^n_e] = \setof{\left(x,\sequence{\varphi^n_{e,i}(x)}{i\in\omega}\right)}{x\in G^n_e},$$
$T^n_e$ is the set of all initial segments of its branches, and $G^n_e=p[T^n_e]$.

Fix some recursive coding of pairs of integers by integers, $i\to\angles{i_0,i_1}$,
with the property that $i_0,i_1\leq i$ for $i\in\omega$.

Now fix a $\PiOneOmega$ code $h$ and we will define the tree $T^h$.
Let $(s,u) \in \omega^n\times(\bdelta^1_{\omega})^n$ for some $n\in\omega$. Then $(s,u)\in T^h$ iff there is an
$x\in\R$ extending $s$ such that for all $i<n$, $x\in G^i_{h(i)}$ and $u(i)=\varphi^{i_0}_{h(i_0),i_1}(x)$.

\begin{remark}
$p[T^h] = A^h$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
Let $(x,f)\in[T^h]$ and fix $n > k > m\in\omega$ such that $\angles{m,i} < n$ for all $i<k$.
Since $(x\restr n, f\restr n) \in T^h$,
there is an $\xprime\in\R$ such that $\xprime\restr n = x\restr n$, $\xprime\in G^m_{h(m)}$,
and for $i<k$, $f(\angles{m,i}) = \varphi^{m}_{h(m),i}(\xprime)$.
So $\left(x\restr k, \sequence{f(\angles{m,i})}{i<k}\right)
=\left(\xprime\restr k, \sequence{\varphi^m_{h(m),i}(\xprime)}{i<k}\right)\in T^m_{h(m)}$.
Since $k>m$ was arbitrary, $x\in p[T^m_{h(m)}] = G^m_{h(m)}$.
Since $m\in\omega$ was arbitrary, $x\in A^h = \Intersection{m} G^m_{h(m)}$.

For $n > m$ let $x_n$ extending $x\restr n$ witness that
$(x\restr n, f\restr n) \in T^h$. Then each $x_n\in G^m_{h(m)}$, and $x_n\rightarrow x_m$ and


Then $(x,f) \in \R \times \pre{(\bdelta^1_{\omega})}{\omega}$
and for all $n,k\in\omega$, $x\in G^n_{h(n)}$ and $f(\angles{n,k}) = \varphi^n_{h(n),k}(x)$.
\end{proof}




Say that $T$ is a $\PiOneOmega$ tree iff $T=T^h$ for some $\PiOneOmega$ code $h$.
\end{definition}

The properties of $T^h$ that we need are
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T^h$ is a tree on $\omega\times\bdelta^1_{\omega}$ that projects to $A^h$
\item The first $n$ levels of $T^h$ are simply definable from $\sequence{G^i_{h(i)}}{i<n}$ and
the norms $\sequence{\varphi^i_{h(i), j}}{i,j<n}$, all of which are $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $M$ be a countable transitive model of $\ZFC$ that is $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$-correct.
Let $A\subset\R$ be $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$, and let $\varphi:A\map\bdelta^1_{2n+1}$ be a regular
$\Pi^1_{2n+1}$ norm on $A$ with associated pre-wellorder $<_\varphi$.
Then there is a natural way to interpret $\varphi$ in $M$.
$\varphi^M:A\intersect M \map (\bdelta^1_{2n+1})^M$
is given by $\varphi^M(x) = $ the rank of $x$ in $<_\varphi \intersect M$.

\begin{definition}
In the situation described in the previous paragraph, we define
$\sigma^M_{\varphi}:\range(\varphi^M)\map\bdelta^1_{2n+1}$ by
$\sigma^M_{\varphi}(\varphi^M(x))=\varphi(x)$ for all $x\in A \intersect M$.
This is well-defined and order preserving since for $x,y\in A\intersect M$,
$\varphi^M(x)=\varphi^M(y)$ iff $\varphi(x)=\varphi(y)$ and
$\varphi^M(x)<\varphi^M(y)$ iff $\varphi(x)<\varphi(y)$.
\end{definition}

Now let $M$ be a countable transitive model of $\ZFC$ that is projectively correct.
Let $h$ be a $\PiOneOmega$ code. We want to study the relationship between
$(T^h)^M$ and $T^h$.

\section{Something D}
\label{section:somethingd}

Suppose that $(S)^{\Mladder}$ is truly-wellfounded and $(T)^{\Mladder}$ is
wellfounded but not truly-wellfounded. We want to see that
$\rank((S)^{\Mladder}) < \rank((T)^{\Mladder})$.

Let $(y,\phi(y))$ be a branch of $T^V$.


We are going to arrange the following situation:

\begin{equation}
\label{big-setup}
\Mladder \xrightarrow{\pi_0} \Mprime \xrightarrow{\pi_1} \Mstar
\end{equation}

where

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ are both $\Sigma_1$-elementary embeddings.
\item $\Mprime$ is a countable ladder mouse.
\item Letting $\alpha=(\omega_1)^{\Mprime}$ and $\delta=\ord(\Mprime)$ we have,
\item $\Mstar$ is is illfounded, $\delta$ is in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$,
\item $\crit(\pi_1) = \alpha$ and $\pi_1(\alpha)=\delta$
\item $\Mprime \subset \Mstar$.
\item $(\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar}$ is in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.
\end{enumerate}

$(\pi_0, \Mprime)$ is going to come from a sequence of genericity iterations using
the initial segments of $\Mladder$ and $(\pi_1,\Mstar)$
is going to come from a stationary tower generic ultrapower of $\Mprime$.

Since $(S)^{\Mstar} \subset \omega^{<\omega}\times ((\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{<\omega}$,
and
$(T)^{\Mstar} \subset \omega^{<\omega}\times ((\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{<\omega}$
$(S)^{\Mstar}$ and $(T)^{\Mstar}$ are both in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.

By elementarity it suffices to show that $\Mstar \models \rank(S) < \rank(T)$.

Since $S^V$ is wellfounded, $S^{\Mstar}$ is wellfouned and so $(\rank(S))^{\Mstar}$ is in the
wellfounded part of $\Mstar$. We will show that $T^{\Mstar}$
is illfounded in $V$ and so $(\rank(T))^{\Mstar}$ is not in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.

We will show that for all $n$, $\phi_n(y)$ is in the range of $\theta^{\Mstar}$ and,
letting $f\in ((\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{\omega}$ be such that for all $n$,
$\theta^{\Mstar}(f(n)) = \phi_n(y)$, we have that $(y,f)$ is a branch of $T^{\Mstar}$.

Thus it suffices to prove

\begin{lemma}
For all $n$, there is a $y_n\in \Mstar$ such that $y_n\restr n = y \restr n$ and
for all $i,j < n$, $\psi^i_j(y_n) = \psi^i_j(y)$.
\end{lemma}
