\title{The Mouse Set Theorem Just Past Projective}

\begin{abstract}
We will describe a natural mouse $M$ and show that $\R\intersect M = Q_{\omega+1}$
where $Q_{\omega+1}$  is the set of reals that are
$\Delta^1_{\omega+1}$ in a countable ordinal. Thus $Q_{\omega+1}$
is a mouse set.

This is analogous to the fact that $\R\intersect M_1 = Q_3$ where $M_1$ is the
canonical inner model with a Woodin cardinal, and $Q_3$ is the set of reals
that are $\Delta^1_3$ in a countable ordinal.

More generally $\R\intersect M_{2n+1} = Q_{2n+3}$.
The pointclass $\Delta_{\omega+1}$  we consider in this paper is the next natural
pointclass to consider in this series of results. It is the analogue of
the $\Delta^1_{2n+3}$ just past projective. Thus we are proving the mouse
set theorem just past projective.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}

We work in $\ZFC+\AD(\LofR)$ for convenience. We need much less determinacy
than this, just a bit past $\PD$.

Throughout this paper we write $\R$ to mean $\Bairespace$ and we call elements of $\Bairespace$ \emph{reals}.

\section{Something A}
\label{section:somethinga}

\begin{definition}
Let $\PiOneOmega$ be the pointclass of recursive intersections of infinitely many (lightface) projective sets.
In more detail, fix for the remainder of this paper, for $n\in\omega$, $G^n\subset\omega\times\R$
a universal $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$ set, uniformly in $n$.

A $\PiOneOmega$ \emph{code} is a total recursive function $h:\omega\to\omega$. If $h$ is a $\PiOneOmega$ code then
$A^h=\setof{x\in\R}{(\forall n) G^n\left(h(n),x\right)}$. $A\subseteq\R$ is $\PiOneOmega$ iff
$A=A^h$ for some $\PiOneOmega$ code $h$.

Similarly we define $\PiOneOmega$ subsets of $\omega^s\times(\R)^t$ for $s,t\in\omega$.

Then we define $\SigmaOneOmega = \neg\PiOneOmega$, $\SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne=\exists^{\R}\PiOneOmega$,
$\PiOneOmegaPlusOne = \forall^{\R}\SigmaOneOmega$ and
$\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne = \SigmaOneOmegaPlusOne \intersect \PiOneOmegaPlusOne$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
We say that $x\in\R$ is $\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne$ in a countable ordinal iff there is an $\alpha<\omega_1$ such
that for all $w\in\WO$ with $|w|=\alpha$, $\singleton{x}$ is $\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne(w)$.
Let $Q_{\omega+1} = \setof{x\in\R}{x\text{ is }\DeltaOneOmegaPlusOne\text{ in a countable ordinal}}$.
\end{definition}

\section{Something B}
\label{section:somethingb}
\begin{theorem}
$Q_{\omega+1} = \R \intersect \Mladder$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Something C}
\label{section:somethingac}

Let $\bdelta^1_{\omega} = \sup_n \bdelta^1_n$.

\begin{definition}
Let $h$ be a $\PiOneOmega$ code for a subset of $\R$.
Then there is a natural tree $T^{h}$ on $\omega\times\bdelta^1_{\omega}$ that projects to $A^h$.

For $n,e\in\omega$, let $G^n_e = \setof{x\in\R}{G^n(e, x)}$ and
let $\varphi^n_e = \sequence{\varphi^n_{e,i}}{i\in\omega}$ be a $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$ scale on $G^n_e$ uniformly in $n$ and $e$,
with each of the norms $\varphi^n_{e,i}$ being regular.
Let $<^n_{e,i}$ be the prewellorder on $\R$ associated with $\varphi^n_{e,i}$. So ``$x,y\in G^n_e$ and $x <^n_{e,i} y$'' is
$\Pi^1_{2n+1}$, uniformly in $n,e,i$, and $\varphi^n_{e,i}(x) = $ the rank of $x$ in $<^n_{e,i}$.

Furthermore, $G^n_e$ is the projection of the tree on $\omega \times \bdelta^1_{\omega}$ whose branches are
$$\setof{\left(x,\sequence{\varphi^n_{e,i}(x)}{i\in\omega}\right)}{x\in G^n_e}.$$

Fix a recursive coding of pairs of integers by integers, $i\to\angles{i_0,i_1}$,
with the property that $i_0,i_1\leq i$ for $i\in\omega$.

Fix a $\PiOneOmega$ code $h$. Now we define the tree $T^h$. Roughly speaking, $T^h$ is the tree of attempts to
build a pair $(x,f) \in \R \times \pre{(\bdelta^1_{\omega})}{\omega}$ such that for all $n,k\in\omega$, $x\in G^n_{h(n)}$
and $f(\angles{n,k}) = \varphi^n_{h(n),k}(x)$.


Let $(s,t) \in \omega^n\times(\bdelta^1_{\omega})^n$ for some $n\in\omega$. Then $(s,t)\in T^h$ iff there is an
$x\in\R$ extending $s$ such that for all $i<n$, $x\in G^i_{h(i)}$ and $\varphi^{i_0}_{h(i_0),i_1} = t(i)$.
\end{definition}

The properties of $T^h$ that we need are
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T^h$ is a tree on $\omega\times\bdelta^1_{\omega}$ that projects to $A^h$
\item The first $n$ levels of $T^h$ are simply definable from $\sequence{G^i_{h(i)}}{i<n}$ and
the norms $\sequence{\varphi^i_{h(i), j}}{i,j<n}$, all of which are $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Something D}
\label{section:somethingd}

Suppose that $(S)^{\Mladder}$ is truly-wellfounded and $(T)^{\Mladder}$ is
wellfounded but not truly-wellfounded. We want to see that
$\rank((S)^{\Mladder}) < \rank((T)^{\Mladder})$.

Let $(y,\phi(y))$ be a branch of $T^V$.


We are going to arrange the following situation:

\begin{equation}
\label{big-setup}
\Mladder \xrightarrow{\pi_0} \Mprime \xrightarrow{\pi_1} \Mstar
\end{equation}

where

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ are both $\Sigma_1$-elementary embeddings.
\item $\Mprime$ is a countable ladder mouse.
\item Letting $\alpha=(\omega_1)^{\Mprime}$ and $\delta=\ord(\Mprime)$ we have,
\item $\Mstar$ is is illfounded, $\delta$ is in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$,
\item $\crit(\pi_1) = \alpha$ and $\pi_1(\alpha)=\delta$
\item $\Mprime \subset \Mstar$.
\item $(\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar}$ is in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.
\end{enumerate}

$(\pi_0, \Mprime)$ is going to come from a sequence of genericity iterations using
the initial segments of $\Mladder$ and $(\pi_1,\Mstar)$
is going to come from a stationary tower generic ultrapower of $\Mprime$.

Since $(S)^{\Mstar} \subset \omega^{<\omega}\times ((\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{<\omega}$,
and
$(T)^{\Mstar} \subset \omega^{<\omega}\times ((\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{<\omega}$
$(S)^{\Mstar}$ and $(T)^{\Mstar}$ are both in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.

By elementarity it suffices to show that $\Mstar \models \rank(S) < \rank(T)$.

Since $S^V$ is wellfounded, $S^{\Mstar}$ is wellfouned and so $(\rank(S))^{\Mstar}$ is in the
wellfounded part of $\Mstar$. We will show that $T^{\Mstar}$
is illfounded in $V$ and so $(\rank(T))^{\Mstar}$ is not in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.

We will show that for all $n$, $\phi_n(y)$ is in the range of $\theta^{\Mstar}$ and,
letting $f\in ((\bdelta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{\omega}$ be such that for all $n$,
$\theta^{\Mstar}(f(n)) = \phi_n(y)$, we have that $(y,f)$ is a branch of $T^{\Mstar}$.

Thus it suffices to prove

\begin{lemma}
For all $n$, there is a $y_n\in \Mstar$ such that $y_n\restr n = y \restr n$ and
for all $i,j < n$, $\psi^i_j(y_n) = \psi^i_j(y)$.
\end{lemma}
