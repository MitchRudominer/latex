\title{The Mouse Set Theorem Just Past Projective}

\begin{abstract}
We will describe a natural mouse $M$ and show that $\R\intersect M = Q_{\omega+1}$
where $Q_{\omega+1}$  is the set of reals that are
$\Delta^1_{\omega+1}$ in a countable ordinal. Thus $Q_{\omega+1}$
is a mouse set.

This is analogous to the fact that $\R\intersect M_1 = Q_3$ where $M_1$ is the
canonical inner model with a Woodin cardinal, and $Q_3$ is the set of reals
that are $\Delta^1_3$ in a countable ordinal.

More generally $\R\intersect M_{2n+1} = Q_{2n+3}$.
The pointclass $\Delta_{\omega+1}$  we consider in this paper is the next natural
pointclass to consider in this series of results. It is the analogue of
the $\Delta^1_{2n+3}$ just past projective. Thus we are proving the mouse
set theorem just past projective.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}

We work in $\ZFC+\AD(\LofR)$ for convenience. We need much less determinacy
than this, just a bit past $\PD$.

\section{Something}
\label{secion:something}

Suppose that $(S)^{\Mladder}$ is truly-wellfounded and $(T)^{\Mladder}$ is
wellfounded but not truly-wellfounded. We want to see that
$\rank((S)^{\Mladder}) < \rank((T)^{\Mladder})$.

Let $(y,\phi(y))$ be a branch of $T^V$.


We are going to arrange the following situation:

\begin{equation}
\label{big-setup}
\Mladder \xrightarrow{\pi_0} \Mprime \xrightarrow{\pi_1} \Mstar
\end{equation}

where

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ are both $\Sigma_1$-elementary embeddings.
\item $\Mprime$ is a countable ladder mouse.
\item Letting $\alpha=(\omega_1)^{\Mprime}$ and $\delta=\ord(\Mprime)$ we have,
\item $\Mstar$ is is illfounded, $\delta$ is in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$,
\item $\crit(\pi_1) = \alpha$ and $\pi_1(\alpha)=\delta$
\item $\Mprime \subset \Mstar$.
\item $(\delta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar}$ is in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.
\end{enumerate}

$(\pi_0, \Mprime)$ is going to come from a sequence of genericity iterations using
the initial segments of $\Mladder$ and $(\pi_1,\Mstar)$
is going to come from a stationary tower generic ultrapower of $\Mprime$.

Since $(S)^{\Mstar} \subset \omega^{<\omega}\times ((\delta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{<\omega}$,
and
$(T)^{\Mstar} \subset \omega^{<\omega}\times ((\delta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{<\omega}$
$(S)^{\Mstar}$ and $(T)^{\Mstar}$ are both in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.

By elementarity it suffices to show that $\Mstar \models \rank(S) < \rank(T)$.

Since $S^V$ is wellfounded, $S^{\Mstar}$ is wellfouned and so $(\rank(S))^{\Mstar}$ is in the
wellfounded part of $\Mstar$. We will show that $T^{\Mstar}$
is illfounded in $V$ and so $(\rank(T))^{\Mstar}$ is not in the wellfounded part of $\Mstar$.

We will show that for all $n$, $\phi_n(y)$ is in the range of $\theta^{\Mstar}$ and,
letting $f\in ((\delta^1_\omega)^{\Mstar})^{\omega}$ be such that for all $n$,
$\theta^{\Mstar}(f(n)) = \phi_n(y)$, we have that $(y,f)$ is a branch of $T^{\Mstar}$.

Thus it suffices to prove

\begin{lemma}
For all $n$, there is a $y_n\in \Mstar$ such that $y_n\restr n = y \restr n$ and
for all $i,j < n$, $\psi^i_j(y_n) = \psi^i_j(y)$.
\end{lemma}
