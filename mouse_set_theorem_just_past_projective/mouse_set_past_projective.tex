\begin{abstract}
We will describe a natural mouse $M$ and show that $\R\intersect M = Q_{\omega+1}$
where $Q_{\omega+1}$  is the set of reals that are
$\Delta^1_{\omega+1}$ in a countable ordinal. Thus $Q_{\omega+1}$
is a mouse set.

This is analogous to the fact that $\R\intersect M_1 = Q_3$ where $M_1$ is the
canonical inner model with a Woodin cardinal, and $Q_3$ is the set of reals
that are $\Delta^1_3$ in a countable ordinal.

More generally $\R\intersect M_{2n+1} = Q_{2n+3}$.
The pointclass $\Delta_{\omega+1}$  we consider in this paper is the next natural
pointclass to consider in this series of results. It is the analogue of
the $\Delta^1_{2n+3}$ just past projective. Thus we are proving the mouse
set theorem just past projective.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}

We work in $\ZFC+\AD(\LofR)$ for convenience. We need much less determinacy
than this, just a bit past $\PD$.
