% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\begin{frame}{The Study of Definable Sets of Reals}

What does "definable" mean?

\pause

  \begin{itemize}
  \item There is a "formula" defining membership.
  \item Examples:
  \item $\setof{x\in\R}{\text{decimal expansion of $x$ has inf many 5's}}$
  \item $\setof{y\in\R}{\exists x\in\R \text{ s.t. } y=\fprime(x)}$ where $f$ is some continuous function.
  \item As opposed to an arbitrary set
  \item Later we'll give two precise definitions
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Themes}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Arbitrary sets of reals may be wild.
  \item Definable sets are regular.
  \item Definability comes in a \emph{hierarchy of complexity}.
  \item The line between wild and regular occurs somewhere in this
  hierarchy. Where?
  \item The answer turns out to be independent of the axioms of set theory
  and deeply connected to large cardinals.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Constructing Wild Sets using AC}

\subsection{A non-measurable set}

\begin{frame}{A non-measurable set}
\begin{theorem}
There is a set of reals that is not Lebesgue Measurable.
\end{theorem}

\vfill

\pause
You need to know very little  about what Lebesgue measure is to
understand the proof. Only that it is
\begin{itemize}
  \item countably additive
  \item translation invariant
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{proof}

\begin{proof}[proof (Vitali 1905)]
We are going to construct a set
$A \subseteq [0, 1]$ so that $[0,1] = A_0 \union A_1 \union \cdots$ where each
$A_n$ is a rigid copy of $A$. Such an $A$ cannot be measurable. Why?

\begin{itemize}
  \item Say $x\equiv y$ iff $x-y$ is rational.
  \item $\equiv$ is an equivalance relation.
  \item Let $A$ be a set that chooses one element of each equivalance class.
  \item Let $\sequence{q_n}{n = 1,2,\cdots}$ enumerate all rational numbers in
$[0,1]$.
   \item Let $A_n = A + q_n$ (mod $\Z$).
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\subsection{The Axiom of Choice}

\begin{frame}{The Axiom of Choice}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $X$ be a family of non-empty sets. Then there exists a choice
  function $f$ for $X$.
  \item Previous proof used AC. How?
\end{itemize}

\begin{question}
Is AC \textbf{necessary} for the previous theorem?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can we \textbf{explicitly define} a set $A\subseteq \R$ that is not measurable?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
 Alternatively can we somehow show that every "definable" set
$A\subseteq \R$ \textbf{is} measurable?
\end{question}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Well-orderings}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{strict linear ordering} of a set $A$ is a binary relation $<$ that is

\begin{itemize}
  \item transitive
  \item asymmetric
  \item connected
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{well-ordering} of a set $A$ is a srict linear ordering $<$ s.t.

\begin{itemize}
  \item every subset of $A$ has a $<$-least element.
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textbf{well-order} is a pair $(A, <)$ where $<$ is a well-ordering of $A$.
\end{definition}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Ordinals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  Every two well-orders $(A, <_A)$ and $(B, <_B)$ are comparable.
  \item  A finite well-order is isomorphic to a an integer $n\geq 0$.
  \item The \emph{order-type} of a well-order is the class of all well-orders
  isomorphic to it.
  \item The \emph{ordinals} are canoncial representatives of the
    order-types of the well-orders.
  \item Transfinite counting numbers.
  \item $\omega = \singleton{0, 1, 2, \cdots }$ is the set of non-negative
    integers. $\omega$ is the first infinite ordinal.
  \item  $\omega_1 = $ the set of all countable ordinals, is the first
    uncountable ordinal
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{AC and well-orders}

The following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  The Axiom of Choice
  \item  Every set can be well-ordered.
  \item For every set $A$ there is a bijection between some ordinal and $A$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A well-ordering of the Reals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  In particular AC implies: \emph{There is a well-ordering of $\R$.}
  \item  This suffices for the Vitali proof.
\end{itemize}

\begin{question}
Can we \textbf{explicitly define} a well-ordering of $\R$?
\end{question}

\begin{fact}
If $<$ is a well-ordering of $\R$ then $<$ itself is
already a non-measurable set (as a subset of $\R^2$).
\end{fact}

\end{frame}
