\section{Rings and Ideals}


\subsection{Exercises}
These are exercises from Chapter 1 of \cite{AtiyahBook}.

\begin{exercise}[exercise 20]
(iv) If $A$ is a ring and $X=\Spec(A)$, then the irredecible components of $X$ are
the closed sets $V(\fp)$ where $\fp$ is a minimal prime ideal.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
In any toplogical space the closure of a point is irreducible and $V(\fp)$ is the closure of $\singleton{\fp}$
so it is irreducible. An arbitrary closed set in $\Spec(A)$ is of the form $V(\fa)$ for
some ideal $\fa$ such that $\fa=r(\fa)$. If $\fa$ is not prime then there are two points
$a,b\notin\fa$ (so that $X_a\intersect V(\fa)\not=\emptyset$ and
$X_b\intersect V(\fa) \not=\emptyset$) such that $ab \in \fa$ (so that
$X_a\intersect X_b \intersect \fa = \emptyset$) so $V(\fa)$ is not irreducible.
In other words the only closed irreducible sets are of the form $V(\fp)$ for
$\fp$ prime.

In any topological space if a point $x$ is in the closure of a different point
$y$ then the closure of $\singleton{x}$ is not a maximal irreducible set so
if $\fp$ is not a minimal prime ideal then $V(\fp)$ is not an irreducible
component.

Finally suppose $\fp$ a prime ideal and $V(\fp)$ is not a maximal irreducible
set. Then by the discussion above there must be a prime ideal $\fq\subset\fp$
in order to yield a closed irreducible set $V(\fq)\supset V(\fp)$, and so
$\fp$ is not a minimal prime ideal.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}[exercise 21]Let $\phi:A\map B$ be a ring homomorhpishm. Let $X=\Spec(A)$
and $Y=\Spec(B)$. Notice that if $\fq\in Y$, then $\phi^{-1}[\fq]\in X$ so $\phi$ induces a mapping
$\phistar:Y\map X$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(iii)] If $\fb$ is any ideal of $B$ then $\overline{\phistar[V(\fb)]} = V(\fb^c)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
(iii) Let $\fp\in \phistar[V(\fb)]$. Then there is $\fq\in V(\fb)$ s.t.
$\fp=\phi^{-1}[\fq]$. So $\fp\in V(\fb^c)$. Since $V(\fb^c)$ is closed we have
$\overline{\phistar[V(\fb)]} \subseteq V(\fb^c)$.

Suppose towards a contradiction that the containment were proper.
Then there is an $E\subseteq A$
such that $\overline{\phistar[V(\fb)]} = V(E)$ and $r(\fb^c) \subsetneqq E$
and $E\subseteq\fp$ for all $\fp$ in $\phistar[V(\fb)]$.

Let $a\in E - r(\fb^c)$. Then $\phi(a)\in\fq$ for all $\fq\in V(\fb)$. But this means that
$\phi(a)\in r(\fb)$ and so $a\in r(\fb^c)$, contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}[exercise 22] Let $A = A_1 \otimes A_2$ be a direct product of rings.
Then $\Spec(A)$ is the disjoint union of two clopen sets $\Spec(A) = U_1 \union U_2$
where $U_1$ is canonically homeomorphic to $\Spec(A_1)$ and $U_2$ is canonically
homeomorphic to $\Spec(A_2)$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
Let $U_1=X_{(1,0)}$ and $U_2=X_{(0, 1)}$. These sets are disjoint because no prime ideal
can omit both $(0, 1)$ and $(1,0)$ because then it would omit their product $(0, 0)$.
The sets cover $\Spec(A)$ because no prime ideal can contain both $(0, 1)$ and
$(1, 0)$ because then it would contain their sum $(1, 1)$.

Let $\fp\in X_{(1, 0)}$.
Then $(0, 1) \in \fp$ which means that $\fp = \fq \times A_2$ for some $\fq \subseteq A_1$ and then
it is easy to see that in fact $\fq$ is a prime ideal, $\fq \in \Spec(A_1)$.
Conversely let $\fq \in \Spec(A_1)$. Then $\fq \times A_2$ is a prime ideal of $A$.
Thus there is a canonical bijection $\pi:\Spec(A_1) \map U_1$ given by
$\pi(\fq) = \fq \times A_2$.

To see that $\pi$ is a homeomorphism notice that if $a\in A_1$ then $\pi[X_a]=X_{(a, 0)}$ so
$\pi^{-1}$ is continuous. Conversely for any $(a, b)$, $\pi^{-1}[X_{(a,b)}] = X_a$, so $\pi$  is continuous.

Similarly $U_2$ is canonically homeomorphic to $\Spec(A_2)$.

As an aside we note that $X_{(a, b)} \subseteq U_1$ iff $b$ is nilpotent. pf. $b$ is nilpotent iff
for all $\fr\in\Spec(A_2)$, $(a,b)\in A_1 \times \fr$ iff $U_2 \intersect X_{(a,b)}=\emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\section{Algebraic Geometry}


\subsection{Exercises}
These are exercises from Chapter 1 of \cite{Kunz_Book}.

\begin{exercise}[Section 1, exercice 5, page 9]
Let $L/K$ be a normal field extension. Two points $(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ and $(y_1,\cdots,y_n)$ in
$\A^n(L)$ are called \emph{conjugate} over $K$ if there is a $K$-automorphism $\sigma$ of $L$
such that $(\sigma(x_1),\cdots,\sigma(x_n))=(y_1,\cdots,y_n)$.

(a) Any $K$-Variety $V\subset\A^n(L)$ that contains $x$ also contains all conjugates of $x$.

(b) If $V\subset\A^n(L)$ is a finite set of points with the property that if $V$ contains $x$
then it also contains all conjugates of $x$ over $K$, then $V$ is a $K$-variety.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
Blah blah blah
\end{proof}
