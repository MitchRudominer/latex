\begin{abstract}
 Let $\kappa^{\R}$ be the least ordinal $\kappa$ such that
$L_{\kappa}(\R)$ is admissible. Let $A = \{x\in\R\;|\;
(\exists\alpha<\kappa^{\R})$ s.t. $x$ is
ordinal definable in $L_{\alpha}(\R)\;\}$. It is well known
that (assuming determinacy) $A$ is the largest countable inductive set
of reals.  Let $T$ be the theory:
$\ZFC$ $-$ Replacement $+$ ``There exists $\omega$ Woodin cardinals which
are cofinal in the ordinals.''  $T$ has consistency strength weaker than
that of
the theory $\ZFC$ $+$ ``There exists $\omega$ Woodin cardinals'', but
stronger than that of
the theory $\ZFC$ $+$ ``There exists $n$ Woodin Cardinals",
for each $n\in\omega$. Let $\cM$ be the canonical, minimal
inner model for the theory  $T$.
In this paper we show that $A=\R\intersect\cM$. Since $\cM$ is
a \emph{mouse}, we say that $A$ is a \emph{mouse set.}
As an application,
we use our characterization of $A$ to give an inner-model-theoretic proof
of a theorem of Martin which states that for all  $n$, every
$\Sigma^*_n$ real is in $A$.
