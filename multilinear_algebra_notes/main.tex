\section{Covariant and Contravariant Tensors}

Let $V$ and $W$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces, 
$\dim(V)=n$, $\dim(W) = m$. Let $\pi:V\map W$ be linear.

\begin{definition}
$V^*$, $W^*$ are the dual-spaces of $V$ and $W$ respectively.
$\pi^*:W^*\map V^*$ is the \emph{adjoint} of $\pi$ defined by
$\pi^*(\varphi) \cdot v = \varphi \cdot \pi(v)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Suppose $\cB = \singleton{v_1,\cdots,v_n}$ is a basis for $V$ and
$\cC=\singleton{w_1,\cdots,w_m}$ is a basis for $W$.
Then $M^{\pi}_{\cB,\cC}$ is the $n\times m$ matrix of of $\pi$ in
the two bases:

 For any matrix $A$ we write $A=(a^i_j)$ to mean that $a^i_j$ is the
 element of $a$ in row $i$, column $j$. 

 Let $M^{\pi}_{\cB,\cC}=A=(a^i_j)$.
Then $a^i_j$ is defined by
$$\pi(c^jv_j) = a^i_j c^j w_i$$
for $1\leq i \leq n$, $1\leq j \leq m$.

Here and in the sequel we are using \emph{index notation} from physics.

\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Suppose $\cB = \singleton{v_1,\cdots,v_n}$ is a basis for $V$ and
$\cC=\singleton{w_1,\cdots,w_m}$ is a basis for $W$. Let
$\hat{\cB} = \singleton{v^1,\cdots,v^n}$ and
$\hat{\cC} = \singleton{w^1,\cdots,w^m}$ be the corresponding
dual bases. So $v^i \cdot v_j = \delta_{ij}$ and $w^i \cdot w_j = \delta_{ij}$
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Let $A = M^{\pi}_{\cB,\cC} =(a^i_j)$.

Then $M^{\pi^*}_{\hat{\cC},\hat{\cB}}  = \transpose{A}$.

But we must be careful with the notation here!

Because we write vectors as column vectors and multiply them by matrices on the left
and we write co-vectors as row-vectors and multiply them by matrices on the right, it
is actually $A$ itself and not $\transpose{A}$ that we will use to represent
$M^{\pi^*}_{\hat{\cC},\hat{\cB}}$.


In index notation, we write the components of vectors using upper indices and the components
of covectors using lower indices. So when representing $\pi$, $A$ acts as
$c^j \to a^i_jc^j$ but when representing $\pi^*$, $A$ acts as $d_k \to a^k_j d_k$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $v=c^j v_j$ and let $\varphi = d_k w^k$. Then $\pi^*(\varphi)\cdot v = \varphi \cdot \pi(v)
= d_k w^k \cdot a^i_j c^j w_i = d_k a^k_j c ^ j$. Therefore $\pi^*(\varphi) = d_k a^k_j v^j$.
\end{proof}
