\textbf{Alternative proof of Theorem 11.}  We have
$$A(x) \Iff \neg \exists y \bigwedge_{n\in\omega}B_n(x,y)$$
and $b_x$ is a $\Pi^1_{\omega}$ code for
$\setof{y}{\forall n B_n(x,y)}$.
We let Let $M=M^{\text{ld}}(x)$.
We have $T = T_{b_x}$ and $T^M =T^M_{b_x}$. We are assuming $A(x)$ is true,
so $T$ is wellfounded (and so is $T^M$.) It suffices to prove

\begin{claim}
There is an $n\in\omega$ and a $z\in\WO\intersect M$ such that
$|T^M| < |T^M_{c^n_z}|$ and $T^M_{c^n_z}$ is w.f. or
$|T^M| < |T^M_{d^n_z}|$ and $T^M_{d^n_z}$ is w.f.
\end{claim}

Here $c^n_z$ and $d^n_z$ are, respectively,
 $\Pi^1_{\omega}$ codes for for the set of $\Pi^1_{\omega}$-iterable, sound putative $x$-ladders $P$ that project to
$\omega$ and have order type $|z|$ and satisfy the $n$-th sentence, respectively
the negation of the $n$-th sentence.

\begin{proof}
Work in a generic extension of $V$, $V[K]$,  such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\R^V$ is countable in $V[K]$, and
\item $V$ and $V[K]$ satisfy the same projective statements with parameters
in $\R^{V}$.
\end{itemize}
(\textbf{Question.} What metatheory should we be working in that will allow
us to do this?)

Let $\sequence{r_i}{i\in\omega}$ enumerate $\R^V$.
Using repeated genericity iterations, iterate $M$ $\omega$ times yielding
$$M \map M_1 \map M_2 \map \cdots$$ so that each $M_i\in V$ and each $M_i$ is
countable in $V$ and $r_i$ is
$\Col(\omega,\delta_i^{M_i})$ generic over $N_i^{M_i}$, where $\delta_i^{M_i}$
and $N_i^{M_i}$ refer to the $i$-th rung of the ladder structure of $M_i$.
Let $M^*$ be the direct limit of the $M_i$. Let $\gamma = o(M^*)$.
So $\gamma=\omega_1^V$ and every initial segment of $M^*$ is in $V$.

Let $G$ be a filter on $\Q_{<\gamma}^{M^*}$ such that for all $i\in\omega$,
$G\intersect \Q_{<\delta_i}^{M^*}$ is generic over $N_i^{M^*}$ and in $V$.

Let $M^{\infty}= \Ult(M^*,G)$.
So $\omega_1^{M^{\infty}} = \omega_1^V$.

Let $P$ be the least initial segment of $M^{\infty}$ that projects to $\omega$
and that contains $\omega_1^M$. Since every initial segment of $M^*$ and $G$ is
in $V$ and countable in $V$,
$P\in V$ and $P$ is countable in $V$. Let $\alpha=o(P)$. Let $z\in WO^V$ with $|z|=\alpha$.

Because any real
coding $P$ is not a $\Pi^1_{\omega}$-in-$\alpha$ singleton, there is an $n$
in $\omega$ such that both $T^V_{c^n_z}$ and $T^V_{d^n_z}$ are ill-founded.
Because the $\sequence{r_i}{i\in\omega}$ enumerate $\R^V$, using the Hjorth
argument, both $T^{M^{\infty}}_{c^n_z}$ and $T^{M^{\infty}}_{d^n_z}$ are ill-founded. It follows that
$M^{\infty}\models$ ``$|T^{M^{\infty}}| < |T^{M^{\infty}}_{c^n_z}|$ or
$T^{M^{\infty}}_{c^n_z}$ is illfounded" and
$M^{\infty}\models$ ``$|T^{M^{\infty}}| < |T^{M^{\infty}}_{d^n_z}|$ or
$T^{M^{\infty}}_{d^n_z}$ is illfounded".

By elementarity, $M\models$ ``$\exists z \in \WO \exists n
\in \omega$ s.t  $T^M_{c^n_z}$ w.f. $\implies
|T^M| < |T^M_{c^n_z}|$ and $T^M_{d^n_z}$ w.f. $\implies
|T^M| < |T^M_{d^n_z}|$". Since $M\models$ ``$\forall z \in \WO$,
$\forall n \in \omega$, $T^M_{c^n_z}$ w.f.
or $T^M_{d^n_z}$ w.f.", we are done.

\end{proof}
