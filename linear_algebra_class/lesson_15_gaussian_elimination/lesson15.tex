\begin{frame}{Theory of Gaussian Elimination}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix.
\item Then there is an invertible $m\times m$ matrix $G$ such that
$GA = B$ is in row echelon form.
\item Furthermore $G$ can be expressed as a product of elementary row operations
of types I and II.
\item $G = E_k \cdots E_2 E_1$.
\item In other words $E_k \cdots E_2 E_1 A = B$ is in row echelon form.
\item In other words, we can perform a series of \emph{row operations} on $A$ to
put it into row echelon form $B$.
\item Furthermore the basic columns of $A$ are the same as the basic columns
of $B$.
\item Furthermore for any right-hand-side vector $\bb$, $A\bx=\bb$ iff
$GA\bx=G\bb$.
\end{itemize}
