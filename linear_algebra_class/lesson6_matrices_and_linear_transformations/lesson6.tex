\begin{frame}{Matrices and Linear Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item What does Lesson 2 Matrices have to do with Lesson 5 Linear functions on $\R^n$?
\item It turns out that an $n\times m$ matrix contains precisely the information we need
to describe a linear function from $\R^m$ to $\R^n$.
\item There is a one-to-one correspondence between $n\times m$ matrices and linear
functions from $\R^m$ to $\R^n$
\item Every matrix gives us a linear function.
\item Every linear function is given by a matrix.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Linear transformations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linear functions from $\R^m$ to $\R^n$ are also often called
linear \emph{transformations}.
\item A linear transformation is exactly the same thing as a linear function.
\item Especially in the context of matrices it is common to use the term
linear transformation instead.
\item From now on we will use the term linear transformation.
\item When using the term \emph{linear transformation}, it is common to use
letters like $T$, $S$ and $R$ to represent the linear transformation rather
than letters like $f$, $g$ and $h$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The linear transformation associated with a matrix.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition:
\item Let $A$ be an $n\times m$ matrix.
\item Then associated with $A$ is a function $T_A:\R^m\map\R^n$.
\item $T_A$ is called the \emph{linear transformation associated with $A$}.
\item $T_A$ is defined as follows. Let $\bv\in\R^m$.
\item Then $T_A(\bv) = A \bv$.
\item Check that this multiplication makes sense and the output is in $\R^n$.
\item We will show that in fact it is linear.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Example. Let
$$
\begin{matrix}
A =
&
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1  & 0 \\
2 &  0  & -1
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bv =
&
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -2 \\ 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$
\item Then
$$
T_A(\bv) =
\begin{pmatrix}
3 \\-1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{$T_A$ is linear}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lemma. Let $A$ be an $n\times m$ matrix.
\item Then $T_A$ is linear.
\item Proof. Let $\bv,\bw\in\R^m$. Let $c,d\in\R$.
\item We must show that
$$T_A(c\bv + d\bw) = c T_A(\bv) + d T_A(\bw)$$
\item i.e. that
$$A(c\bv + d\bw) = c A(\bv) + d A(\bw)$$
\item But this just follows from the properties of matrix arithmetic.
\item Namely matrix multiplication distributes over matrix addition,
\item and matrix multiplication is compatible with scalar multiplication.
\item So $T_A$ is linear. $\qed$

\pause

$T_A(\be_j)$ is the $j$-th column of $A$.

A linear transformation is determined by its values at the standard basis vectors.

\begin{lemma}
Let $T:\R^m\map\R^n$ and $S:\R^m\map\R^n$  be two linear transformations. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Proof of Lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\bv\in\R^m$ be any vector.
\uncover<2->{We must show that $T(\bv)=S(\bv)$.}
\uncover<3->{
Now $\bv = (v_1,v_2,\cdots v_n)^{\text{T}}$.
So $\bv=\sum_j{v_j \be_j}$.
}

\begin{align*}
\uncover<4->{T(\bv) &= T\left(\sum_j{v_j \be_j}\right) \\}
\uncover<5->{&= \sum_j{v_j T(\be_j)} \text{ \qquad (by linearity)}\\}
\uncover<6->{&= \sum_j{v_j S(\be_j)} \text { \qquad (by assumption)}\\}

\begin{frame}{Every linear transformation is given by a matrix}

\begin{theorem}
Let $T:\R^m\map\R^n$ be a linear transformation.

\pause

\small

Then there is an $n\times m$ matrix $A$ such that $T = T_A$
\end{theorem}

\pause

\begin{proof}
For $j=1\dots m$, let $\ba_j = T(\be_j)$.

\pause

i.e. let $\ba_1 = T(\be_1), \ba_2 = T(\be_2), \cdots \ba_m = T(\be_m)$.

\pause

So each $\ba_j\in\R^n$.

\pause

Let $A = (\ba_1 \vert \ba_2 \vert \cdots \vert \ba_m) $ be the matrix composed of the columns $\ba_1, \ba_2 , \cdots \ba_m$.

\pause

So $A$ is an $n\times m$ matrix.

\pause

Then $T_A(\be_j) = \ba_j = T(\be_j)$.

\pause

So $T_A = T$.

\end{proof}
