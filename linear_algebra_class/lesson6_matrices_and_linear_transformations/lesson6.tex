\begin{frame}{Matrices and Linear Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item What does Lesson 5: Matrices have to do with Lesson 4: Linear functions on $\R^n$?
\item It turns out that an $n\times m$ matrix contains precisely the information we need
to describe a linear function from $\R^m$ to $\R^n$.
\item There is a one-to-one correspondence between $n\times m$ matrices and linear
functions from $\R^m$ to $\R^n$
\item The function is given by multiplication of the matrix by the input vectors.
\item Furthermore multiplication of two matrices corresponds exactly to the composition of two linear functions.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Linear transformations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linear functions are also often called linear \emph{transformations}.
\item A linear transformation is exactly the same thing as a linear function.
\item Especially in the context of matrices it is common to use the term
linear transformation.
\item From now on we will usually use the term linear transformation.
\item When using the term \emph{linear transformation}, it is common to use
letters like $T$, $S$ and $R$ to represent the linear transformation rather
than letters like $f$, $g$ and $h$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The linear transformation associated with a matrix.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition:
\item Let $A$ be an $n\times m$ matrix.
\item Then associated with $A$ is a function $T_A:\R^m\map\R^n$.
\item $T_A$ is defined as follows. Let $\bv\in\R^m$.
\item Then $T_A(\bv) = A \bv$.
\item Check that this multiplication makes sense and the output is in $\R^n$.
\item $T_A$ is called the \emph{linear transformation associated with $A$}.
\item We will show that in fact it is linear.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Example. Let
$$
\begin{matrix}
A =
&
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1  & 0 \\
2 &  0  & -1
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bv =
&
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -2 \\ 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$
\item Then
$$
T_A(\bv) =
\begin{pmatrix}
3 \\-1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{$T_A$ is linear}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lemma. Let $A$ be an $n\times m$ matrix.
\item Then $T_A$ is linear.
\item Proof. Let $\bv,\bw\in\R^m$. Let $c,d\in\R$.
\item We must show that
$$T_A(c\bv + d\bw) = c T_A(\bv) + d T_A(\bw)$$
\item i.e. that
$$A(c\bv + d\bw) = c A(\bv) + d A(\bw)$$
\item But this just follows from the properties of matrix arithmetic.
\item Namely matrix multiplication distributes over matrix addition,
\item and matrix multiplication is compatible with scalar multiplication.
\item So $T_A$ is linear. $\qed$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Which linear transformation is $T_A$?}

\begin{itemize}
\item So $T_A$ is a linear tranformation.
\item Question: Which linear transformation is $T_A$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Row vectors}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\sigma$ be $1\times m$ row vector.
\item Then $T_{\sigma}:\R^m \map \R$.
\item So $T_{\sigma}$ is a linear functional.
\item So $T_{\sigma}$ is given by a \emph{covector} on $\R^m$.
\item We will see that it is exactly the covector associated with $\sigma^{\text{T}}\in\R^m$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Row vectors are covectors}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\bw\in\R^m$.

\pause

Let $\sigma = \bw^{\text{T}}$. So $\sigma$ is a $1\times m$
row vector.

\pause

Then $T_{\sigma} = f_{\bw}$, the covector associated with $\bw$.
\end{lemma}

\pause

\begin{proof}
Let $\bv\in\R^m$. Then
\pause
\begin{align*}
&T_{\sigma}(\bv) \\
&=\sigma \bv \quad \text{ (defintion of linear transformation associated with a matrix ) }\\
&=\bw \cdot \bv \quad \text{ (defintion matrix multiplication ) }\\
&= f_{\bw}(\bv) \quad \text{ (defintion $f_{\bw}$) }
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{frame}{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let
$$
\bw =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 2 \\ 3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item So $\bw\in\R^3$.
\item Let $\sigma = \bw^{\text{T}}$.
\item So $\sigma = (1, 2, 3)$ is a $1\times 3$ row vector.
\item Let
$$
\bv =
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\ 0 \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item So $\bv\in\R^3$.
\item Then $T_{\sigma}(\bv)$
\item $=\sigma \bv$
\item $=\bw\cdot \bv =f_{\bw}(\bv)$
\item $=2$
