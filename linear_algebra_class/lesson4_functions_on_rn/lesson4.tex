\begin{itemize}
\item Putting together Lesson 3 ``Vectors in $\R^n$'' and Lesson 1: ``Functions''
\item Now we consider a function $f:\R^n \map \R^m$.
\item Domain of $f$ is vectors in $\R^n$, codomain or target space is vectors
in $\R^m$.
\item In this lesson we just want to get used to thinking about these.
\item What does a function $f:\R^n \map \R^m$ ``look like''?
\item It takes as input a vector with $n$ real components and gives as output
a vector with $m$ real components.
\item How would we write a formula for such a function?
\item Could we graph such a function?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Component function notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f:\R^n \map \R^m$.
\item Let $\bv \in \R^n$ and $\bw \in \R^m$ and suppose $f(\bv) = \bw$.
\item Now $\bv = (v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n)^{\text{T}}$
\item and $\bw = (w_1, w_2, \cdots w_m)^{\text{T}}$
\item We could write $f(\bv) =$
\item $ = \left(f_1(\bv), f_2(\bv), \cdots f_m(\bv)\right)^{\text{T}}$
\item = $f(\bw)$.
\item $f_1,f_2,\cdots f_m$ are called the \emph{component functions} of $f$.
\item The output of $f_i$ is the $i$-th component of the output of $f$.
\end{itemize}
