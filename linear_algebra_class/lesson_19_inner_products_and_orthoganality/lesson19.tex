\begin{frame}{$\R^n$ is more than a vector space}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $\bv$ is a vector in $\R^n$ we know how to take its length.
\item But if $\bv$ is a vector in an abstract vector space, there is no meaning to its length.
\item If $\bv$ and $\bw$ are vectors in $\R^n$ we know how to measure the angle between them.
\item We know whether or not the two vectors are orthogonal.
\item But if $\bv$ and $\bw$ are vectors in an abstract vector space, the notions of angle and orthogonal don't make sense.
\item What is going on? Why do these geometric concepts make sense in $\R^n$ but not in an abstract vector space?
\item $\R^n$ is more than just a vector space. $\R^n$ has additional structure.
\item It is possible to give an abstract vector space this additional structure.
\item It is called an inner product.

\begin{frame}{Inner Product on a Real Vector Space}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition} Let $V$ be a real vector space.
\item An \emph{inner product} on $V$ is a function from $V\times V$ to $\R$
\item written as $\angles{\bv,\bw}$, such that, the function is
\item (i) Bilinear: $\angles{c\bv+d\bu,\bw} = c\angles{\bv,\bw} + d\angles{\bu,\bw}$, and
\item $\angles{\bv,c\bu + d\bw} = c\angles{\bv,\bu} + d\angles{\bv,\bw}$, and
\item (i) Symmetric: $\angles{\bv,\bw}=\angles{\bw,\bv}$, and
\item (ii) Positive Definite: $\angles{\bv,\bv} > 0$ if $\bv\not=0$.
\item A vector space $V$ along with an inner product $\angles{\cdot, \cdot}$, is
called an \emph{inner product space.}
