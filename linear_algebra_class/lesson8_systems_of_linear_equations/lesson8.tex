\begin{frame}{Systems of linear equations}

\begin{itemize}
\item We now temporarily turn to a new topic:
\item systems of simultaneous linear equations.
\item We will show that solving such a system is equivalent to
\item solving a matrix equation. Which is equivalent to
\item solving an equation involving a linear transformation.
\item This is an example of the interplay between the concrete and the abstract.
\item Questions about a system of linear equations (concrete)
\item Questions about a matrix equation (more abstract)
\item Questions about a linear transformation (most abstract)
\item We will see how understanding the abstract helps us to understand the
concrete.
\item And vice-versa.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A system with 4 equations and five unknowns}

Consider the following system of equations:

\begin{align*}
 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item There are 5 \emph{unknowns}: $x, y, z, u, v$.
\item There are 4 \emph{equations}.
\item The numbers 2, 8, 13, -3 constitute the \emph{right-hand-side}
\item The goal is to find values for the unknowns in order to make all of the
equations simultaneously true.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Questions about a system}

What are the questions we want to ask about the system?

\begin{align*}
 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Are there any solutions?
\item If not the system is called \emph{inconsistent}
or \emph{incompatible}. Otherwise the system is called consistent or compatible.
\item Assuming the system is consistent, is there a unique solution or is there
more than one solution?
\item If there is not a unique solution the system is
called \emph{underdetermined.}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{More questions}

What are the questions we want to ask about the system?

\begin{align*}
 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item If there is a unique solution how do we find it?
\item If there is more than one solution, how do we describe the set of
all solutions?
\item We will show how to convert the system into an equivalent
matrix equation and an equivalent linear transformation equation.
\item We will then translate these questions into questions about
matrices and linear transformations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The matrix of coefficients}

\begin{align*}
 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

Let $A$ be the $4 \times 5$ \emph{matrix of coefficients}:

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2

 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

Let $\bx$ be the $5 \times 1$  \emph{column vector of unknowns}:

$$
\begin{matrix}
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bx =
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z \\ u \\ v
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The right-hand-side column vector}

\begin{align*}
 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

Let $\bb$ be the $4 \times 1$  \emph{right-hand-side column vector}:

$$
\begin{matrix}
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bx =
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z \\ u \\ v
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bb =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\ 8 \\ 13 \\ -3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Equivalent matrix equation}

\begin{align*}
 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

Then the system says exactly the same thing as the matrix equation $A \bx = \bb$.

$$
\begin{matrix}
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bx =
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z \\ u \\ v
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bb =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\ 8 \\ 13 \\ -3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Equivalent matrix equation}

\begin{align*}
 x + 3y + 2z - u  \qquad &= 2 \\
2x + 6y + z + 4u + 3v  &= 8 \\
-x -3y  -3z + 3u + v  &= 13 \\
3x + 9y + 8z  -7u + 2v  &= -3 \\
\end{align*}

Names of the variables are irrelevant. Real problem: Find all vectors $\bx \in \R^5$ such that $A \bx = \bb$.

$$
\begin{matrix}
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}

\bb =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\ 8 \\ 13 \\ -3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\

\end{pmatrix}
&
\bb =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\ 8 \\ 13 \\ -3

$$

\begin{itemize}
\item The problem: ``find all vectors $\bx \in \R^5$ such that $A \bx = \bb$''
\item is equivalent to the problem
\item ``find all vectors $\bx \in \R^5$ such that $T_A(\bx) = \bb$''
\item which can be stated as
\item ``find the inverse image under $T_A$ of $\singleton{\bb}$''
\item and written as
\item find $T_A^{-1} \left[ \singleton{\bb}\right]$.

\begin{frame}{General system of linear equations}

A general linear system of $m$ equations in $n$ unknowns has the form:

\begin{align*}
 a_{11}x_1 &+ a_{12}x_2 + &\cdots + a_{1n} x_n &= b_1\\
 a_{21}x_1 &+ a_{22}x_2 + &\cdots + a_{2n} x_n &= b_2\\
 \quad &{ \vdots \quad} \quad &{ \vdots \quad} \quad  &{ \vdots \quad} \quad\\
 a_{m1}x_1 &+ a_{m2}x_2 + &\cdots + a_{mn} x_n &= b_m
\end{align*}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Associated Matrix Equation}

Associated to a general linear system of equations is the matrix of coefficients
$A$ and the right-hand-side vector $\bb$. The
matrix equation $A\bx = \bb$ is equivalent to the original system.

$$

A =
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
