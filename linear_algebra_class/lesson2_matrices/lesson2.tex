\begin{frame}{Matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item A (real) \emph{matrix} is a rectangular array of real numbers.
\item We draw matrices, as in the example below, inside of elongated, curved
braces.
\item An $m\times n$ matrix (pronounded ``$m$-by-$n$'') has $m$-rows and $n$-columns.
\item If $A$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix, we say its \emph{size} is $m$-by-$n$.
\item We always list the number of rows before the number of columns.
\item The matrix $A$ below is a $4\times 5$ matrix because it has 4 rows
and 5 columns.
\item The size of $A$ is $4\times 5$.
\end{itemize}

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Entries of a matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item We usually use capital Roman letters (lightface font), like $A$ or $M$, to name matrices.
\item The number in row $i$, column $j$ is called the $(i,j)$-th \emph{entry}.
\item If the matrix is called $A$ then by convention the symbol $a_{ij}$ refers
to the $(i,j)$-th entry of $A$.
We always list the row index first and the column index second.
\item For the matrix $A$ displayed below, the $(2,3)$-entry is 1 and the
$(3,2)$-entry is -3.
\end{itemize}

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Square matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item If the number of rows equals the number of columns then the matrix is
called a \emph{square} matrix.
\item The matrix $M$ below is a square $2\times 2$ matrix.
\item If a matrix is not square it is called \emph{rectangular.}
\item The $4\times 5$ matrix $A$ from the previous slide is rectangular.
\end{itemize}

$$
M =
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Row vectors and column vectors}

\begin{itemize}
\item A $1\times n$ matrix, with $n>1$, is called a \emph{row vector}.
\item $\ba$ below has size $1\times 4$ so it is a row vector.
\item An $m\times 1$ matrix, with $m>1$, is called a \emph{column vector}.
\item $\bv$ below has size $3\times 1$ so it is a column vector.
\item We often use boldface lower-case letters for row and column vectors,
as below where we used $\ba$ and $\bv$,
instead of names like $A$ and $M$.
\end{itemize}

$$
\begin{matrix}
\ba =
\begin{pmatrix}
2, 2, 0, 1
\end{pmatrix}

&

\bv =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-5
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Vector indexing}

\begin{itemize}
\item We sometimes refer to the entries of a vector as \emph{components}.
\item We use a slightly different notation for the components of a vector
than we do for the entries of a matrix.
\item For a row vector like $\ba$ we will often drop the row
index 1 and write only the column index.
\item So instead of writing $\ba_{1,3} = 0$,
\item we write $a_3 = 0$. Notice also the lightface font.
\item Similarly for column vectors like $\bv$ below we will often
drop the column index 1 and write only the row index.
\item So instead of writing $\bv_{2,1} = 0$,
\item we may write $v_2 = 0$.
\end{itemize}

$$
\begin{matrix}
\ba =
\begin{pmatrix}
2, 2, 0, 1
\end{pmatrix}

&

\bv =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-5
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Transpose of a vector}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $\bv$ is an $n\times 1$ column vector, then $\bv^{\text{T}}$
(pronounced $\bv$-\emph{transpose}) is the corresponding $1\times n$ row vector.
\item If $\ba$ is a $1\times n$ row vector, then $\ba^{\text{T}}$ is the
corresponding $n\times 1$ column vector.
\item $$(1, 0, -5)^{\text{T}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}$$
\item $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}^{\text{T}} =  (1, 0, -5)$$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Scalars}

\begin{itemize}
\item The things which can be entries in a matrix are called \emph{scalars}.
\item Scalars are just numbers but the word \emph{scalar} emphasizes that it
is a different type of thing than a matrix or a vector.
\item For a real matrix, the scalars are real numbers.
\item Later in the class we will consider matrices in which the scalars
are complex numbers.
\item A $1\times 1$ matrix is identified with a scalar.
\item For example the $1\times 1$ matrix $(42)$ is considered to
be just the scalar 42.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Matrix multiplication}

\begin{itemize}
\item The most important thing we do with matrices is multiply two of
them together.
\item Let $A$ be an $n\times m$ matrix. Let $B$ be a $m\times k$ matrix.
\item Then the product $A B$ is defined.
\item $A B$ is the $n\times k$ matrix defined as follow:
\item Let $C=A B$. Then for $1\leq i \leq n$, and $1\leq j \leq k$,
\item $$c_{ij} = \sum_{t=1}^m a_{it} b_{tj}$$
\item To understand this better, we will look at some special cases first.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Which products are defined?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $A$ and $B$ are matrices of the sizes given below. Say
whether the product $A B$ is defined and if so say what its size is.
\item $A$ is $3\times 4$ and $B$ is $3\times 5$.
\item  $A B$ is not defined.
\item $A$ is $3 \times 4$ and $B$ is $4 \times 5$.
\item $A B$ is $3 \times 5$.
\item $A$ is $5\times 1$ and $B$ is $6\times 1$.
\item $A B$ is not defined.
\item $A$ is $5\times 1$ and $B$ is $1\times 6$.

\item $ = 1\cdot 4 + (-1)\cdot (-2) + 2\cdot 5$
\item $=16$
\item The product of a row vector times a column vector
\emph{of the same length} is just the \emph{dot product} of the two vectors.

$$O_{2\times 3} =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0

write $O$ for the zero matrix.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Main diagonal}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $A$ is a square $n\times n$ matrix, then the entries on the
\emph{main diagonal} of $A$ are the entries $a_{11}, a_{22}, \cdots a_{nn}$
whose row and column are equal.
\item Let
$$A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Diagonal matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{diagonal} matrix is a \emph{square} matrix such that all
of the entries \emph{off of the main diagonal} are zero.
\item Let
$$A =
\begin{pmatrix}

0 & 5 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 9

$$
\item Then $A$ is a diagonal matrix.
\item We sometimes write $\diag(a_1,a_2,\cdots, a_n)$ for the $n\times n$
diagonal matrix whose entries on the main diagonal are $a_1,a_2,\cdots, a_n$.
\item The matrix $A$ above would be written $\diag(1,5,9)$.

\begin{frame}{Identity matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item The matrix
$$I_n = \diag(1, 1, \cdots 1)$$

$$
I_3 =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1

$$
\item If the size of the matrix is clear from context we will often just
write $I$ instead of $I_n$.
\item So we would write
$$
I=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1

\begin{frame}{Associative law for matrix multiplication}

\begin{itemize}
\item Matrix multiplication \emph{is} associative.
\item $A (B C) = (A B) C$ whenever the multiplication is defined.
\item Let's first check that the sizes make sense.
\item Let $A$ be $n\times m$, $B$ be $m\times k$, $C$ be $k\times l$.
\item Then $B C$ is $m\times l$ and so $A (B C)$ is $n \times l$.
\item $A B$ is $n\times k$ so $(A B) C$ is $n \times l$.
\item So it is at least possible that $A (B C) = (A B) C$
\item To check that they are equal we could expand out the formula for
the $(i, j)$-th element of $A (B C)$  and the formula for the
$(i, j)$-th element of $(A B) C$ and show that they are equal.
\item This is not hard, but messy.
\item Instead we will postpone the proof that matrix multiplication is
associative to a later lesson where we will be able to do it more easily
and more abstractly.

\begin{frame}{Distributive law for matrix mulitplication}

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Matrix multiplication distributes over matrix addition
\item<2-> $A (B + C) = A B + A C$
\item<3-> Assuming $A$ is $n\times m$ and $B$ and $C$ are $m\times k$.
\item<4-> $(B + C) A = B A + C A$
\item<5-> Assuming $B$  and $C$ are $n\times m$ and $A$ is $m\times k$.
\item<6-> Proof:
\begin{align*}
&\sum_{t=1}^m a_{it} (b_{tj} + c_{tj}) \\
\uncover<7->{&=  \sum_{t=1}^m a_{it} b_{tj} + a_{it} c_{tj} } \\
\uncover<8->{&=  \sum_{t=1}^m a_{it} b_{tj} + \sum_{t=1}^m a_{it} c_{tj}}

\begin{frame}{Matrix multiplication and scalar multiplication}

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Matrix multiplication is compatible with scalar multiplication
\item<2-> $c (A B) = (c A) B = A (c B)$
\item<3-> Proof:
\begin{align*}
&c \sum_{t=1}^m a_{it} b_{tj} \\
\uncover<4->{&=  \sum_{t=1}^m (c a_{it}) b_{tj} } \\
\uncover<5->{&=  \sum_{t=1}^m a_{it} (c b_{tj}) }
