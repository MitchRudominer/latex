\begin{frame}{Eigen Pairs}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $A$ be a square matrix and suppose $\bv\not=\bzero$ is a vector and $\lambda$ is a scalar such that
\item $A\bv=\lambda\bv$.
\item Then $\left(\lambda, \bv \right)$ is called an \emph{eigen pair} for $A$.
\item $\lambda$ is called an \emph{eigenvalue} of $A$.
\item $\bv$ is called and \emph{eigenvector} of $A$ \emph{corresponding to} $\lambda$.
\item We can also make this definition for abstract linear transformations.
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $T:V\map V$ be a linear transformation. Let $\bv\in V, \bv\not=\bzero$, and $\lambda$ a scalar be such that
\item $T(\bv)=\lambda\bv$.
\item Then $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$  and $\bv$ is a corresponding eigenvector.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example Eigen Pair}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let
$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\text{, }
\bv=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\
2
\end{pmatrix}
= 2
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
.
$
\item $A\bv = 2 \bv$
\item 2 is an eigenvalue of $A$.
\item
$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$
is a corresponding eigenvector.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Eigen lines}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma} Let $A$ be a square matrix and let $\bv$ be an eigenvector for $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$.
\item Let $c\not=0$ be a scalar.
\item Then $c\bv$ is also an eigenvector for $A$ corresponding to $\lambda$.
\item In other words, every nonzero vector in the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by $\bv$ is also an eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda$.
\item \textbf{proof.} If $A\bv=\lambda\bv$ then $Ac\bv=cA\bv=c\lambda\bv=\lambda c\bv$. $\qed$
\item For example
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\
2
\end{pmatrix}
= 2
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item So also
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
-3 \\
-3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-6 \\
-6
\end{pmatrix}
= 2
\begin{pmatrix}
-3 \\
-3
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item So
$
\begin{pmatrix}
-3 \\
-3
\end{pmatrix}
$
is also an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 2.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Vector Fields}

\begin{itemize}
\item A nice way to visualize a linear transformation from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$,
and in particular to visualize its eigenvectors, is via the concept of
a vector field.
\item \textbf{Definition.} A linear \emph{vector field} on $\R^n$ is a linear transformation
$T:\R^n\map\R^n$.
\item But we picture the transformation as assigning an arrow (an output vector in $\R^n$)
to each input point in $\R^n$.
\item For example let's try to visualize $T_A$, for $A$ the matirx
we were just looking at
$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}.
$
\item We will visualize $T_A$ as a vector field on $\R^2$.
\item At each point $\bv\in\R^2$, draw the arrow corresponding to the vector $A\bv$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example Vector Field}

\begin{itemize}
\item $A=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}.
$
\item $A\bzero=\bzero$ so we put the zero arrow at the origin.
\item
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\
-1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item
So we put the arrow
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 \\
-1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
at the point
$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\
 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-2 \\
4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item
So we put the arrow
$
\begin{pmatrix}
-2 \\
4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
at the point
$
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item It's hard to get very far doing this by hand.

Here is a picture of the \emph{flow} of that vector field.

\pause

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\pause

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{flow} through a vector field in $\R^2$ is a system of curves
in $\R^2$ such that at each point of the plane, the tangent vector to the
curve at that point is equal to the vector from the vector field at that point.
\item Intuitively, it is the flow that a fluid would take if the fluid were forced
to have a prescribed velocity at each point of the plane.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Flow of a vector field}


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{stream1}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item The flow through a vector field is basically the integral of the vector field.
\item This is something you can learn more about in a class on ordinary differential equations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Special directions in the flow of a vector field}


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{stream1}

\begin{itemize}
\item There are two lines through the origin that are special for this flow. Can you spot them?
\item The line $y=x$ and the $y$-axis. What is special about them?
\item The flow through a point on these lines remains on these lines.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The special directions are the eigen lines}


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{stream1}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item The special lines in the flow are precisely the eigen lines.
\item $A\bv=\lambda\bv$
\item means that at the point $\bv$ in the plain the velocity of the flow is $\lambda\bv$
\item and so the flow is parallel to the vector $\bv$ itself
\item and so the flow remains on the line through $\bv$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
\item Earlier we saw that
$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$
is an eigenvector for our matrix $A$
\item and so is every nonzero vector on the line through
$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item i.e. the line $y=x$.

\begin{itemize}
\item The flow picture suggests that
$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
1

$
should also be an eigenvector.
\item
$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\

\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\

\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
3
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\

$
\item 3 is also an eigenvalue of $A$.
\item
$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
1

$
is a corresponding eigenvector.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors}


\begin{itemize}
\item How do we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix $A$?
\item We are looking for solutions to the equation $A\bv=\lambda\bv$
where $\bv$ and $\lambda$ are both unknowns.
\item This is not a linear system of equations. So we cannot simply apply Gaussian elimination.
\item The trick is to do the following:
\item Let $I$ be the identity matrix. Then
\item $A\bv=\lambda\bv \SkipImplies A\bv = \lambda I \bv$
\item $\SkipImplies (A-\lambda I) \bv = 0$.
\item We are looking for a nonzero vector $\bv$ and a scalar $\lambda$ such that $(A-\lambda I) \bv = 0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors}


\begin{itemize}
\item We are looking for a nonzero vector $\bv$ and a scalar $\lambda$ such that $(A-\lambda I) \bv = 0$.
\item We are looking for a nonzero vector $\bv$ and a scalar $\lambda$ such that $\bv\in\ker(A-\lambda I)$.
\item Notice this implies that $A - \lambda I$ is singular.
\item \textbf{Lemma.} $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ iff $(A-\lambda I)$ is singular.
\item $\bv$ is a corresponding eigenvector iff it is in the kernel of $(A-\lambda I)$.
\item This gives us a technique for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Computing Eigenvalues}


\begin{itemize}
\item We are looking for a scalar $\lambda$ such that $A-\lambda I$ is singular.
\item We are looking for a scalar $\lambda$ such that $\det(A-\lambda I) = 0$.
\item Notice that if we think of $A$ is a fixed matrix and $\lambda$ as a variable then $\det(A-\lambda I)$ is an
$n$-th degree \emph{polynomial} in $\lambda$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Characteristic Polynomial}


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. Then
\item $p(\lambda) = \det(A-\lambda I)$
\item is called the \emph{characteristic polynomial} of $A$.
\item It is a polynomial of degree $n$.
\item Example:
\item Let $A=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item Compute the characteristic polynomial of $A$.
\item $p(\lambda)=\det(A-\lambda I)$
\item
$
= \det
\begin{pmatrix}
2 - \lambda & 0 \\
-1 & 3 - \lambda
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item
$
= (2-\lambda)(3-\lambda) - 0 = (2-\lambda)(3-\lambda)
$
\item $p(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 6$.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Roots of the characteristic Polynomial}


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. Let
\item $p(\lambda)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $A$.
\item Then $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ iff $\lambda$ is a root of $p(\lambda)$.
\item For this reason, another name for eigenvalue is \emph{characteristic root}.
\item Example:
\item Let $A=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item $p(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 6$
\item
$
= (\lambda-2)(\lambda-3).
$
\item So the characteristic roots of $A$ are 2 and 3.
\item So the eigenvalues of $A$ are 2 and 3.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Eigenspace}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $T:V\map V$ be a linear transformation and let
$\lambda$ be an eigenvalue for $T$.
\item The set of all eigenvectors corresponding
to $\lambda$ is a nontrivial subspace of $V$ called the \emph{eigenspace} corresponding
to $\lambda$.
\item \textbf{proof.} The eigenspace is just the kernel of $T-\lambda I$ and so
it is a subspace.
\item It is nontrivial because $T - \lambda I$ is singular by definition of eigenvalue. $\qed$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Example of eigenspace}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $A=

\item Find the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $2$.
\item Find the kernel of $A-2I$.
\item Find the kernel of
$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
-1 & 1

$
\item To do this we can use Gaussian elimination and back-substitution
\item
$
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
-1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\SkipImplies
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item $-x + y = 0 \SkipImplies x = y$.
\item So the eigenspace is is given by
$
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
y \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
=
y
\begin{pmatrix}

\item In other words, the eigenspace is the 1-dimensional subspace consisting of
all multiples of $\transpose{(1,1)}$.

\begin{frame}{Algebraic and Geometric Multiplicity}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Suppose $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$.
\item The \emph{algebraic multiplicty} of $\lambda$ is the the multiplicty of $\lambda$ as a root
of the characteristic polynomial of $A$.
\item The \emph{geometric multiplicty} of $\lambda$ is the dimension of the eigenspace of $\lambda$.
\item Both values must be between 1 and $n$.
\item Example.  Let
$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
-1 & 3
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item The eigenvalues of $A$ are 2 and 3.
\item The algebraic multiplicity of both 2 and 3 is one because the characteristic
polynomial of $A$ is $p(\lambda) = (\lambda -2)(\lambda -3)$ and each of 2 and 3
are roots of multiplicty 1 in $p(\lambda)$.
\item The geometric multiplicity of both 2 and 3 is 1 because the eigenspace
both have dimension 1.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Example 2}

\begin{itemize}
\item It's not always the case that the algebraic and geometric multiplicity
of an eigenvalue is the same. Let's look at some other examples.
\item Let

3 & -1 \\
1 & 5

\item Compute the eigenvalues of $A$ and the corresponding eigenspaces.
\item Compute the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalue.
\item First we compute the characteristic polynomial of $A$.
\item $p(\lambda) = \det(A-\lambda I)$
\item $=\det

\item $p(\lambda) =\lambda^2 - 8\lambda + 16$
\item The eigenvalues of $A$ are the roots of $p(\lambda)$.
\item $p(\lambda) = (\lambda - 4)^2$.
\item So $4$ is the only eigenvalue of $A$ and it has algebraic multiplicity 2.

\begin{itemize}
\item $A=

\item Now let's find the eigenvectors.
\item Find the null space of $A-4 I=
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & -1 \\
1 & 1

\item
$
\SkipImplies
\begin{pmatrix}

\begin{frame}{Complex matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item Because we must confront the fact that a real matrix may have complex eigenvalues,
\item even if we only care about $\R^n$, we are forced to consider vectors and matrices over $\C$.
\item Everything that we have learned in the class so far about vectors and matrices and vector spaces and linear transformations over $\R$
\item applies equally well to vectors and matrices and vector spaces and linear transformations over $\C$.
\item When working over $\C$ you allow your scalars to be complex numbers.
\item You allow the entries in your matrices and vectors to be complex numbers.
\item But everything else (for example how you multiply two matrices together) works the same way.
\end{itemize}
