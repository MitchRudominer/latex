\begin{frame}{Basis}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $V$ be a vector space and let $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$ be $n$ vectors in $V$.
\item We say that $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$ is a \emph{basis} for $V$ if
\item (i) $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$ are linearly independent
\item (ii) $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$ span $V$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example of a basis}

\begin{itemize}
\item The standard basis vectors of $\R^n$ are a basis for $\R^n$.
\item Let $V = \R^3$.
\item Let $\be_1 =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
$,
$\be_2 =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 1 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
$,
$\be_3=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}
$.

\item Then $\be_1,\be_2,\be_3$ are a basis for $\R^3$.
\item To see this we need to recall that they are
\item (i) linearly independent, and
\item (ii) span $\R^3$.
\item So the standard basis vectors form a basis.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Dimension}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $V$ be a vector space
\item Suppose $V$ has a basis consisting of $n$ vectors.
\item Then we say that the \emph{dimension} of $V$ is $n$.
\item Or that $V$ is $n$-dimensional.
\item \textbf{Example.} $\R^n$ is $n$-dimensional.
\item Because $\R^n$ has a basis consisting of the $n$ standard basis vectors.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Is dimension well-defined?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space.
\item So $V$ has a basis consisting of $n$ vectors.
\item Question: Is it possible that $V$ also has a different basis
consisting of $m$ vectors, for some $m\not=n$?
\item If this is possible, then $V$ is also $m$-dimensional.
\item And so the dimension of $V$ is not well-defined.
\item We will show that this cannot happen.
\item We will show that every basis for $V$ has the same size.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Dimension is well-defined}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $V$ be a vector space and let $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$ be a basis for $V$.
\item Let $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots,\bw_n$  be any $n$ linearly independent vectors of $V$.
\item Then $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots,\bw_n$ are also a basis.
\item \textbf{Proof.} Let's just deal with the two dimensional case.  Let $V$ be a two dimensional
vector space with basis $\bv_1,\bv_2$.
\item Let $\bw_1,\bw_2$ be linearly
independent. We will show they also form a basis.
\item We need to show that the span of $\bw_1,\bw_2$ is all of $V$.
\item Notice that it suffices to show that $\bv_1,\bv_2\in\spn(\bw_1,\bw_2)$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proof continued.}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\bw_1 = c_1\bv_1 + c_2\bv_2$, for some scalars $c_1, c_2$.
\item Since $\bw_1\not=\bzero$, either $c_1$ or $c_2$ is non-zero. Say $c_1 \not= 0$.
\item So then $\bv_1 = (1/c_1)\bw_1 - (c_2/c_1)\bv_2$.
\item So $\bv_1\in\spn(\bw_1,\bv_2)$.
\item But then $\bv_1,\bv_2\in\spn(\bw_1,\bv_2)$.
\item So $\spn(\bw_1,\bv_2)=V$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proof continued.}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\bw_2 = c_1\bw_1 + c_2\bv_2$, for some scalars $c_1, c_2$.
\item Since $\bw_1, \bw_2$, are linearly independent, $c_2 \not= 0$.
\item So then $\bv_2 = (1/c_2)\bw_2 - (c_1/c_2)\bw_1$.
\item So $\bv_2$ is in the span of $\bw_1$ and $\bw_2$.
\item So $V=\spn(\bw_1,\bv_2)\subseteq\spn(\bw_1,\bw_2)$.
\item So $\spn(\bw_1,\bw_2) = V$.
\item So $\bw_1,\bw_2$ span all of $V$ and so they form a basis. $\qed$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Dimension is well-defined}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $V$ be a vector space and let $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$ be a basis for $V$.
\item Let $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots\bw_m$ be any other vectors with $m > n$.
\item Then $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots\bw_m$ are linearly dependent.
\item \textbf{proof.} Suppose $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots\bw_m$ are linearly independent. We will derive a contradiction.
\item $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots,\bw_n,\cdots,\bw_m$ are linearly independent.
\item In particular $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots,\bw_n$ are linearly independent.
\item So by the previous lemma $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots,\bw_n$ are a basis
\item so then $\bw_{n+1}$ can be written as a linear combination of $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots,\bw_n$
\item but then $\bw_1,\bw_2,\cdots\bw_m$ are not linearly independent. $\qed$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Dimension is well-defined}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $V$ be a vector space and suppose $V$ has two different bases,
\item one with $n$ elements and one with $m$ elements.
\item Then $n=m$.
\item i.e. all bases for $V$ have the same number of elements. So the dimension of $V$ is well-defined.
\item \textbf{Proof.} This follows from the previous lemma
\item because if one basis had fewer
elements than the other one, then the one with more elements would be linearly dependent. $\qed$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Dimension of subspaces}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space.
\item Let $W$ be a subspace of $V$.
\item Then $\dim(W) \leq \dim(V)$.
\item \textbf{proof}
\item If $W$ is the zero space then it has dimension zero. So let $\bw_1\in W$.
\item If $\bw_1$ spans $W$ then $W$ is one dimensional. Otherwise let $\bw_2\in V-\spn(\bw_1)$.
\item If $\bw_1,\bw_2$ spans $W$ then $W$ is two dimensional.
\end{itemize}
