\begin{frame}{Matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item A (real) \emph{matrix} is a rectangular array of real numbers.
\item We draw matrices, as in the example below, inside of elongated, curved
braces.
\item An $m\times n$ matrix (pronounded ``$m$-by-$n$'') has $m$-rows and $n$-columns.
\item If $A$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix, we say its \emph{size} is $m$-by-$n$.
\item We always list the number of rows before the number of columns.
\item The matrix $A$ below is a $4\times 5$ matrix because it has 4 rows
and 5 columns.
\item The size of $A$ is $4\times 5$.
\end{itemize}

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Entries of a matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item We usually use capital Roman letters (lightface font), like $A$ or $M$, to name matrices.
\item The number in row $i$, column $j$ is called the $(i,j)$-th \emph{entry}.
\item If the matrix is called $A$ then by convention the symbol $a_{ij}$ refers
to the $(i,j)$-th entry of $A$.
We always list the row index first and the column index second.
\item For the matrix $A$ displayed below, the $(2,3)$-entry is 1 and the
$(3,2)$-entry is -3.
\end{itemize}

$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 6 & 1 & 4 & 3\\
-1 & -3 & -3 & 3 & 1 \\
3 & 9 & 8 & -7 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Square matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item If the number of rows equals the number of columns then the matrix is
called a \emph{square} matrix.
\item The matrix $M$ below is a square $2\times 2$ matrix.
\item If a matrix is not square it is called \emph{rectangular.}
\item The $4\times 5$ matrix $A$ from the previous slide is rectangular.
\end{itemize}

$$
M =
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\
0 & \frac{-1}{5}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Row vectors and column vectors}

\begin{itemize}
\item A $1\times n$ matrix, with $n>1$, is called a \emph{row vector}.
\item $\sigma$ below has size $1\times 4$ so it is a row vector.
\item An $m\times 1$ matrix, with $m>1$, is called a \emph{column vector}.
\item $\bv$ below has size $3\times 1$ so it is a column vector.
\item We often use a different naming convention for row and column vectors
than we do for other matrices, as below where we used $\sigma$ and $\bv$
instead of names like $A$ and $M$.
\end{itemize}

$$
\begin{matrix}
\sigma =
\begin{pmatrix}
2, 2, 0, 1
\end{pmatrix}

&

\bv =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
-5
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

\begin{frame}{What are vectors in $\R^n$?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Previously, before we started talking about matrices, we said that
a \emph{vector in $\R^n$} is an $n$-tuple of numbers.
\item But now we have row vectors and column vectors. So which one of these
things is what we were previously calling a vector in $\R^n$?
\item Answer: Column vectors.
\item Convention: A vector in $\R^n$, from now on, is an $n\times 1$
column vector.
\item So then what is a row vector?
\item We will use row vectors to represent covectors.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Transpose of a row vector}

\begin{itemize}
\item Previously, before we started talking about matrices, we might have
written let $\bv = (1, 0, -5)$. Then $\bv\in\R^3$.
\item But the problem with this is that the definition of $\bv$ makes it look
like a row vector, and we just said that elements of $\R^n$ are column
vectors.
\item So from now on we will write instead, let $\bv = (1, 0, -5)^{\text{T}}$.
\item The superscript ``T'' is read \emph{transpose}.
\item It means to interchange the rows and columns of a matrix.
\item We will study the transpose operation in detail later in the course.
\item For now we only use the fact that the transpose of a row vector is a
column vector.
\item $$(1, 0, -5)^{\text{T}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}$$
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Matrix multiplication}

\begin{itemize}
\item The most important thing we do with matrices is multiply two of
them together.
\end{itemize}
