\textbf{Problem 1.}

\textbf{a.} Yes $f$ is injective because if $(x_0, y_0) \not= (x_1, y_1)$
then $(x_0 +1 , y_0 +1) \not= (x_1 +1 , y_1 +1)$ and so
 $(x_0 +1 , y_0 +1, 5) \not= (x_1 +1 , y_1 +1, 5)$.


\textbf{b.} No $f$ is not surjective. For example the origin of $\R^3$ is not in
the range. Only points with $z$-coordinate equal to 5 are in the range.


\textbf{c.} $\singleton{(4, -6)}$


\textbf{d.}$\emptyset$


\textbf{e.} The line: $y=1$, $z=5$. In other words $\setof{(x,y,z)}{y=1, z=5}$

\medskip

\textbf{Problem 2.}

\textbf{a.} No $g$ is not injective. For example
$g(0,0,0) = g(0, 0,1) = (0,0)$.


\textbf{b.} No $g$ is not onto. For example $(0, -1)$ is not in the range of
$g$ because only points with non-negative $y$-coordinates are in the range.


\textbf{c.} The inverse image of the origin in $\R^2$ is the $z$-axis in $\R^3$.


\textbf{d.} The inverse image of the $x$-axis in $\R^2$ is the $x$- $z$- plane
in $\R^3$

\textbf{e.} The inverse image of the horizontal line $y=1$ in $\R^2$ is
the union of two planes in $\R^3$ parallel to the $x$- $z$- plane: The
plane $y=1$ and the plane $y=-1$.

\textbf{f.} The image of the $x$-axis in $\R^3$ is the $x$-axis in $\R^2$.

\textbf{g.} The  image of the line $y=x$ in the $x$- $y$- plane
of $\R^3$ is the parabola $y=x^2$ in $\R^2$.


\medskip

\textbf{Problem 3.}

\textbf{a.}  The domain and target are $\R^2$.
$h(x,y) = (x+1, (y+1)^2)$.
The range is $\setof{(x,y)}{y\geq 0}$.

\medskip

\textbf{b.} No. For example $h(0,0) = h(0, -2) = (1, 1)$


\textbf{c.} No, because the range does not include the lower half-plane.

\textbf{d.} The inverse image of the origin is the set $\singleton{(-1, -1)}$.

\textbf{e.} The image of the $x$-axis is the $x$-axis.


\textbf{f.} The image of the $y$-axis is the vertical half-line
$\setof{(1, y)}{y\geq 1}$.

\textbf{g.} The inverse image of the $x$-axis is the $x$-axis.

\textbf{h.} The inverse image of the $y$-axis is the vertical line $x=-1$.

\textbf{i.} Yes $f \circ g$ is defined because the target of $g$ is the domain
of $f$, namely $\R^3$.

\medskip

\textbf{Problem 4.}

\textbf{a.} The function $f:\R^2\map\R^3$ defined by
$$f(x,y) = (x, y, 0 )$$
is one-to-one but not onto.

\textbf{b.} Let $f:\R^2\map\R^3$ be defined by
$$f(x,y) = (x, 0, 0)$$
Then $f$ is neither one-to-one nor onto.

\textbf{c.} Let $f:\R^3\map\R^2$ be defined by
$$f(x,y, z) = (x, y)$$
Then $f$ is onto but not one-to-one.

\bigskip

\textbf{d.} Let $f:\R^3\map\R^2$ be defined by
$$f(x,y, z) = (x, 0)$$

Then $f$ is neither one-to-one nor onto.


\medskip

\textbf{Problem 5.}

\smallskip

\textbf{a.} Yes. For example, in polar coordinates,
$$f(r,\theta) = \big( \tan^{-1}(r), \theta \big).$$
Then $f$ is one-to-one but not onto. In fact $f$ maps the whole plain onto
the open disk of radius $\pi/2$.


\textbf{b.} Yes, for example, in polar coordinates, let
$f(r,\theta) = (r, 2\theta)$. Then $f$ is onto but not one-to-one.


\textbf{c.} Yes, but this one is tricky. There is no algebraic formula that
will give such a function. In fact we know from Set Theory that there is a
bijection between every $\R^n$ and $\R^m$. This follows from the fact that
for every infinite set $X$ there is a bijection between $X$ and $X^2$.

\medskip

\textbf{Problem 6.} $f^{-1}[D] = [0,1].$

\medskip

\textbf{Problem 7.}
The only function that could possibly yield the given level sets is
(3) $f(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

\medskip

\textbf{Problem 8.}

\textbf{a.} The image of the unit disk is the interval on the $x$-axis
$[-1, 1]$.

\textbf{b.} The image of the purple unit disk is the orange line segment.
The images of the red points are the green points directly below them.
