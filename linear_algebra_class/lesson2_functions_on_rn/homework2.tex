\bigskip

\textbf{d.} Give an example of a function $f:\R^3\map\R^2$ that is neither
one-to-one nor onto.


\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 5.} These are more difficult than problem 4. Don't worry
if you can't solve them.
\smallskip

\textbf{a.} Is it possible for $f:\R^2\map\R^2$ to be one-to-one but not onto?
If so give an example. If not explain why.

\bigskip

\textbf{b.} Is it possible for $f:\R^2\map\R^2$ to be onto but not one-to-one?
If so give an example. If not explain why.

\bigskip

\textbf{c.} Is it possible for $f:\R^3\map\R^2$ to be one-to-one?

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 6.} Let $f:[0, \infty)\map \R^2$ be defined by
$$f(t) = (t \cos(\pi t), t \sin(\pi t))$$

Using the technique of drawing the range within the target space we may picture
$f$ as follows:

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{spiral}

Let $D$ be the unit disk in $\R^2$: that is, $D$ is the set of points whose
distance from the origin is at most 1. What is $f^{-1}[D]$?

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 7.} Suppose $f:\R^2\map\R$ and the following is a picture
of $f$ using the technique of drawing some of the level sets inside of the
domain of $f$.

\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{circles}

The red, blue and green circles are, respectively the inverse
images of $\singleton{1}$, $\singleton{2}$ and $\singleton{3}$.

Which of the following could be the function $f$?

\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(x,y) = x + y$
\item $f(x, y) = x^2$
\item $f(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
\item $f(x,y) = xy$
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\textbf{Problem 8.} Let $f:\R^2 \map \R^2$ be defined by $f(x,y) = (0, y)$.

\smallskip

\textbf{a.} What is the image of the unit disk?

\bigskip

\textbf{b.} Draw a picture of $f$ using the technique of representing the
domain and the target space using the same copy of $\R^2$ and illustrating
the unit disk and its image. Show a few individual points in the domain and
their images.
