\begin{frame}{Rank of a matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix.
\item So $T_A:\R^n\map\R^m$.
\item Recall that the range (or image) of $T_A$ is equal to the span of the
columns of $A$.
\item \textbf{Definition.} The \emph{rank} of $A$, written $\rank(A)$,
is the dimension of the span of the columns of $A$.\
\item Equivalently, the dimension of the image of $T_A$.
\item Equivalently, the size of a maximal linearly independent subset of
the columns of $A$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example of rank}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find the rank of $A$.
\item $A=
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 0  & 1 \\
0  & 1  & 3 \\
2  & 0  & 2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item The first two columns are linearly independent but the third column
is a linear combination of the first two columns.
\item So $\rank(A) = 2$.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example 2 of rank}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find the rank of $A$.
\item $A=
\begin{pmatrix}
-3  & 2  & 1 \\
0   & 1  & 3 \\
0   & 0  & 2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item The three columns are linearly independent. We know this because the
matrix is upper-triangular with nonzeros on the diagonal.
\item So $\rank(A) = 3$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Special forms of matrics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some matrices are in a form where it is easy to read off information
about them, such as their rank.
\item For example, we have already seen upper-triangular matrices with
nonzeros on the diagonal.
\item We will now study a generalization of this form called \emph{row-echelon} form.
\end{itemize}

\end{pmatrix}
$
\begin{itemize}
\item The bolded columns are called the \emph{pivot} columns. The red entries are the pivots.
\item The pivots must all be non-zero.
\item There must be zeros below the pivots.
\item Above the pivots can be anything.
\item The first pivot is the first entry of the first pivot column.
\item The second pivot is the second entry of the second pivot column. Etc.

\mathbf{0}                  & \textcolor{red}{\mathbf{-1}} & -2  & 1 & \mathbf{0}                  & 0  \\

\end{pmatrix}
$
\begin{itemize}
\item The pivot columns are linearly independent.
\item One way to see this is to notice that if we pull out only the pivot columns
we can add additional columns to form a matrix in upper-triangular form with all zeros on the diagonal.

$
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3,\cdots$ be the pivot columns.
\item Notice $\bv_1$ is a scalar multiple of the first standard basis vector $\be_1$.
\item So $\spn(\bv_1) = \spn(\be_1)$.
\item Notice that $\be_2\in\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2)$.
\item So $\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2) = \spn(\be_1,\be_2)$.
\item Notice that $\be_3\in\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3)$.
\item So $\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3) = \spn(\be_1,\be_2,\be_3)$.

$
\begin{itemize}
\item The non-pivot columns are in the span of the earlier pivot columns.
\item In our example, the third and fourth columns are in $\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2) = \spn(\be_1,\be_2)$.
\item And the sixth column is in  $\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_3) = \spn(\be_1,\be_2,\be_3)$.
\item This is because, by definition of row-echelon form, the non-pivot columns must have zeros
in all entries below the previous pivots.
