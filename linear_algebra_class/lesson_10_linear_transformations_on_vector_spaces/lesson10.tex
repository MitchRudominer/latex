\begin{frame}{Linear transformations}

\begin{itemize}
\item The definition of linear transformation makes sense on an arbitrary vector space.
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $V$ and $W$ be two vector spaces.
\item Let $T:V\map W$.
\item Then $T$ is \emph{linear} iff
\item (a) $T$ preserves vector addition: $T(\bv+\bw) = T(\bv) + T(\bw)$.
\item (b) $T$ preserves scalar multiplication: $T(c\bv) = c T(\bv)$.
\item Linear Algebra is the study of linear transformations between vector spaces.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples of linear transformations}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $V=\R^n$ and $W=\R^m$ and $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix then
$T_A$ is a linear transformation from $V$ to $w$.
\item Let $\cD$ be the space of all differentiable functions $f:\R\map\R$.
\item Let $\cF$ be the space of all functions $f:\R\map\R$.
\item Let $T:\cD\map\cF$ be defined by $T(f) = \fprime$.
\item Then $T$ is linear.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{More examples of linear transformations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $C^0$ be the space of all continuous functions $f:\R\map\R$.
\item Let $T:C^0\map C^0$ be defined by $T(f) = F$ where $F$ is the
anti-derivative of $F$ such that $F(0) = 0$.
\item i.e. $F(x) = \int_{t=0}^x f(t) dt$.
\item Then $T$ is linear.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The image of zero}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $T:V\map W$ be a linear transformation.
\item Then $T(\bzero) = \bzero$.
\item \textbf{proof.} Let $\bw = T(\bzero)$. We must show that $\bw=\bzero$.
\item $\bw = T(\bzero) = T(0 \bzero) = 0 T(\bzero) = 0 \bw = \bzero$. $\qed$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The Kernel of a linear transformation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $T:V\map W$ be a linear transformation.
\item The \textbf{kernel} of $T$, $\ker(T)$ is
\item $\setof{v\in V}{T() = \bzero}$.
\item $\ker(T) = T^{-1}[\singleton{\bzero}]$.
\item The kernel of $T$ is also called the \textbf{nullspace} of $T$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The Kernel is a subspace}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $T:V\map W$ be a linear transformation.
\item Then $\ker(T)$ is a subspace of $V$.
\item textbf{proof.} We must show $\ker(T)$ contains $\bzero$ and is closed
under addition and scalar multiplication.
\item $T(\bzero) = \bzero$.
\end{itemize}
