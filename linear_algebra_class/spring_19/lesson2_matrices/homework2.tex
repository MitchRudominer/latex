\maketitle

This homework is from our textbook,
\textbf{Applied Linear Algebra}, Second Edition, by Peter J. Olver.

\bigskip

\textbf{1.} Read section 1.2 \emph{Matrices and Vectors}. But ignore the part
about a general linear system of equations. We have not covered that yet.
We will cover it in a later lesson. Do the following exercises:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1.2.1
\item 1.2.2
\end{itemize}


\bigskip

\textbf{2.} Read the section called \emph{Matrix Arithmetic} on pages 5 through
8. Do the following exercises:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1.2.6
\item 1.2.7
\item 1.2.9
\item 1.2.10
\item 1.2.11
\item 1.2.19
\item 1.2.20
\item 1.2.37 (a) and (b). (You can do parts (c) and (d) for fun but they are
quite challenging and you will not be responsible for knowing them.)
\end{itemize}
