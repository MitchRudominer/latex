\begin{frame}{Functions from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$}

\begin{itemize}
\item Putting together Lesson 3 ``Vectors in $\R^n$'' and Lesson 1: ``Functions''
\item Now we consider a function $f:\R^n \map \R^m$.
\item Domain of $f$ is vectors in $\R^n$, codomain or target space is vectors
in $\R^m$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example: Function from $\R^2$ to $\R^3$}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f:\R^2\map\R^3$ be defined by
\item
$$
f
\left(
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
\right)
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2x \\ y \\ y^2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item We will abbreviate this as
$$
f
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2x \\ y \\ y^2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item We will abbreviate it even further as
$$f(x,y) = (2x, y, y^2)^{\text{T}}$$
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Example continued}
$f:\R^2\map\R^3$ is defined by
$$f(x,y) = (2x, y, y^2)^{\text{T}}$$
\begin{itemize}
\item The component functions are
\item $f_1(x,y) = 2x$
\item $f_2(x,y) = y$
\item $f_3(x,y) = y^2$

\begin{frame}{Linear transformations on $\R^n$}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f:\R^n \map \R^m$.
\item $f$ is called \emph{linear} iff $f$ satisfies the following two properties:
\item (i) For every two vectors $\bv, \bw \in\R^n$, $$f(\bv + \bw) = f(\bv) + f(\bw)$$
\item (ii) For all vectors $\bv\in\R^n$ and all scalars $c\in \R$,
$$f(c \bv) = c f(\bv)$$
\item In short we say ``f preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.''
\item We say $f$ is a linear function.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{$f$ Preserves Addition}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{preserving-addition}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item $f(\bv + \bw) = f(\bv) + f(\bw)$
\item Let $f(\bv) = \bv^{\prime}$.
\item Let $f(\bw) = \bw^{\prime}$.
\item We can compute a vector sum on the left: $\bv + \bw$.
\item We can compute a vector sum on the right: $\bv^{\prime} + \bw^{\prime}$.
\item $f$ must move the vector sum on the left to the vector sum on the right.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{$f$ Preserves Scalar Multiplication}

\begin{itemize}
\item $f(c \bv) = c f(\bv)$
\item Let $f(\bv) = \bv^{\prime}$.
\item Let $c = 2$.
\item We can compute a scalar multiplication on the left: $2 \bv$.
\item We can compute a scalar multiplication on the right: $2 \bv^{\prime}$.
\item $f$ must move the scalar multiple on the left to the scalar multiple on the right.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example}
Suppose $f:\R^2\map\R^3$ is defined by
$$f(x,y) = (2x, y, y^2)^{\text{T}}$$

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{z-equals-y-squared}

\begin{itemize}
\item Is $f$ linear?
\item Check: Does $f$ preserve vector addition?
\item Let $\bv, \bw \in \R^2$
\item We need to check if $f(\bv + \bw) = f(\bv) + f(\bw)$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Does $f$ preserve vector addition?}
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(x,y) = (2x, y, y^2)^{\text{T}}$.
\item Let $\bv = (0,1)^{\text{T}}$ and $\bw = (1,1)^{\text{T}}$.
\item Let $\bv+\bw = (1,2)^{\text{T}}$.
\item $f(\bv) = f(0,1) = (0,1,1)^{\text{T}}$.
\item $f(\bw) = f(1,1) = (2,1,1)^{\text{T}}$.
\item $f(\bv+\bw) = f(1,2) = (2,2,4)^{\text{T}}$.
\item $f(\bv) + f(\bw) = (0,1,1)^{\text{T}} + (2,1,1)^{\text{T}} = (2,2,2)^{\text{T}}$.
\item So $f(\bv) + f(\bw) \not= f(\bv +\bw)$.
\item So $f$ does not preserve vector addition, so $f$ is not linear.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Linear transformations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linear functions from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$ are also often called
linear \emph{transformations}.
\item From now on we will use the term linear transformation.
\item When using the term \emph{linear transformation}, it is common to use
letters like $T$, $S$ and $R$ to represent the linear transformation rather
than letters like $f$, $g$ and $h$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The linear transformation associated with a matrix.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition:
\item Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix.
\item Then associated with $A$ is a function $T_A:\R^n\map\R^m$.
\item $T_A$ is called the \emph{linear transformation associated with $A$}.
\item $T_A$ is defined as follows. Let $\bv\in\R^n$.
\item Then $T_A(\bv) = A \bv$.
\item Check that this multiplication makes sense and the output is in $\R^m$.
\item We will show that in fact it is linear.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Example. Let
$$
\begin{matrix}
A =
&
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1  & 0 \\
2 &  0  & -1
\end{pmatrix}
&
\bv =
&
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ -2 \\ 3
\end{pmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$
\item Then
$$
T_A(\bv) =
\begin{pmatrix}
3 \\-1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{$T_A$ is linear}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix.
\item Then $T_A$ is linear.
\item Proof.
\item We must show that $T_A$ preserves vector addition.
$$T_A(\bv + \bw) = T_A(\bv) + T_A(\bw)$$
\item But this is true because matrix multiplication distributes over matrix addition.
$$A(\bv + \bw) = A\bv + A\bw$$
\item We must show that $T_A$ preserves scalar multiplication.
$$T_A(c \bv) = c T_A(\bv)$$
\item But this is true because matrix multiplication is compatible with scalar multiplication.
$$A(c \bv ) = c A\bv$$
\item So $T_A$ is linear. $\qed$

\begin{frame}{Every linear transformation is given by a matrix}

\begin{theorem}
Let $T:\R^n\map\R^m$ be a linear transformation.

\pause

\small

Then there is an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ such that $T = T_A$
\end{theorem}

\pause

\begin{proof}
For $j=1\dots n$, let $\ba_j = T(\be_j)$.

\pause

i.e. let $\ba_1 = T(\be_1), \ba_2 = T(\be_2), \cdots \ba_n = T(\be_n)$.

\pause

So each $\ba_j\in\R^m$.

\pause

Let $A = (\ba_1 \vert \ba_2 \vert \cdots \vert \ba_n) $ be the matrix composed of the columns $\ba_1, \ba_2 , \cdots \ba_n$.

\pause

So $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix.

\pause

Then $T_A(\be_j) = \ba_j = T(\be_j)$.

\pause

So $T_A = T$.
