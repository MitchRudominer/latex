\begin{frame}{Inverse matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $A$ be any matrix.
\item Suppose there is another matrix $B$ such that $AB = BA = I$.
\item Then we say that $B$ is the \emph{inverse} of $A$, or $B$ is $A$-inverse,
and we write $B=A^{-1}$. And $A=B^{-1}$.
\item $A$ and $B$ must be square matrices of the same size. Why?
\item Compare to the multiplicative inverses of numbers. What is $2^{-1}$?
\item $2^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}$.
\item $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Inverses Are Unique}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $B$ and $C$ are two inverses of $A$ then $B=C$.
\item \textbf{proof} Suppose $AB = BA = AC =CA = I$.
\item Then $B = BI = B(AC) = (BA)C = I C = C \qed$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{$T_A$ and $T_B$ are inverses}

\begin{itemize}
\item If $A$ and $B$ are $n\times n$ matrices and
\item $AB = BA = I$, then
\item $T_A$ and $T_B$ are inverse functions.
\item $T_A:\R^n\map\R^n$, $T_B:\R^n\map\R^n$.
\item $T_A\circ T_B = I$.
\item $T_B\circ T_A= I$.
\item So $T_A$ and $T_B$ are both bijections.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{$AB=I$ is enough}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $A$  and $B$ be $n\times n$ matrices.
\item Suppose $AB=I$.
\item Then $A$ and $B$ are inverses.
\item In other words, you don't need to check that $BA=I$.
\item \textbf{proof.} To see that $BA=I$ it is enough to see that for all
vectors $\bw$, $BA\bw=\bw$.
\item Since $AB=I$ we know that for all vectors $\bv$, $AB\bv=\bv$.
\item Let $\bw$ be any vector. Since $T_B$ is a bijection let $\bv$ be such
that $B\bv=\bw$.
\item $BA\bw=BA(B\bv) = B (AB)\bv = B\bv = \bw$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Invertible Matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item Does every matrix have an inverse?
\item Firstly non-square matrices don't have inverses.
\item Does every square matrix have an inverse?
\item No. Only matrices $A$ such that $T_A$ is a bijection.
\item For example, the zero matrix does not have an inverse.
\item A square matrix is called \emph{invertible} if $A^{-1}$ exists.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Inverting the action of a matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $A$ be an invertible matrix. How do we find $A^{-1}$?
\item One way to find the inverse of a matrix is to think about
about its linear transformation as an \emph{action} on vectors.
\item Understand what the matrix does to vectors and try to find
a matrix that does the inverse of that.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The inverse of a diagonal matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item Example: Let
$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item Decide if $A$ is invertible and if so find $A^{-1}$.
\item Let's understand the action of $A$ on vectors.
\item Consider
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2x \\ -3y \\ 4z
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item What does $A$ do to a vector $\bv$?
\item It multiplies the first component by 2, the second component by -3
and the third component by 4.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The inverse action}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let
$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item What action must $A^{-1}$ do to a vector?
\item It must multiply the first component by $\frac{1}{2}$, the second component by
$\frac{-1}{3}$  and the third component by $\frac{1}{4}$.
\item So we must have that
$$
A^{-1} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{-1}{3} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item Check
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{-1}{3} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} \\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\

\item Example: Let
$$
B =

0 & 0 & 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\item Decide if $A$ is invertible and if so find $A^{-1}$.
\item Let's understand the action of $A$ on vectors.
\item Consider
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
2x \\ 0 \\ 4z

$$
\item What does $A$ do to a vector $\bv$?
\item It multiplies the first component by 2, the second component by 0
and the third component by 4.

\begin{frame}{Undoing the action}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can we find a matrix that can undo the action of the matrix
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}
?
$$
\item No we cannot.
\item Because multiplying by zero is not invertible.
\item Multiplying by 0 is not one-to-one.
\item $B$ is not invertible.
\item We can also see that because the columns of $B$ are not
linearly independent since one of the columns is the zero vector.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Inverses of diagonal matrics}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $D=\diag(d_1,d_2,\cdots,d_n)$
be a diagonal $n\times n$ matrix.
\item If any of the $d_i$ are zero then $D$ is singular (non-inveritble.)
\item If all of the $d_i$ are nonzero then $D$ is nonsingular (inveritble)
and the inverse of $D$ is

\begin{frame}{The Determinant of a $2\times 2$ Matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let
$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b  \\
c & d  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
be any $2\times 2$ matrix.
\item The number $ad-bc$ is called the \emph{determinant} of $A$, written $\det(A)$ or $\left | A \right |$.
\item Square matrices of all sizes have determinants. We will learn about
determinants for larger square matrices later.
\item Determinants play an important role in the theory of Linear Algebra.
\item The determinant of a matrix is a single number that gives us some information
about the whole matrix.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The Determinant and the Inverse}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let
$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b  \\
c & d  \\
\end{pmatrix}
\text{, }
B=
\begin{pmatrix}
d & -b  \\
-c & a  \\
\end{pmatrix}.
$
\item Two slides ago we computed
$AB = \det(A)
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0  \\
0 & 1  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item \textbf{Theorem.} $A$ is invertible iff $\det(A)\not=0$.
\item If $A$ is invertible then
$$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}
\begin{pmatrix}
d & -b  \\
-c & a  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proof}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Proof.} Let
$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b  \\
c & d  \\
\end{pmatrix}
\text{, }
B=
\begin{pmatrix}
d & -b  \\
-c & a  \\
\end{pmatrix}.
$
\item So
$AB = \det(A)
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0  \\
0 & 1  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item If $\det(A)\not=0$, then we can divide by it and get that
$$A \left ( \frac{1}{\det(A)}B \right) = I.$$
\item So $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}B$.
\item So $A$ is invertible.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proof}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Proof continued.} We have
$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b  \\
c & d  \\
\end{pmatrix}
\text{, }
B=
\begin{pmatrix}
d & -b  \\
-c & a  \\
\end{pmatrix}.
$
\item and
$AB = \det(A)
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0  \\
0 & 1  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item If $\det(A)=0$ then we have $AB=O$.
\item Let $\bv_1,\bv_2$ be the columns of $B$.
\item So $A\bv_1 = \bzero$ and $A\bv_2 = \bzero$.
\item If $\bv_1=\bv_2=\bzero$ then $B=O$ and so $A=O$ and
so $A$ is not invertible.
\item So assume one of $\bv_1$ or $\bv_2$ is not zero.
\item But they are in $\ker(A)$.
\item So $\ker(A)$ is not trivial.
\item So $A$ is not invertible. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}
