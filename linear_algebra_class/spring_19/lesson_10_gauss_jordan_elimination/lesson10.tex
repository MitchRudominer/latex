\begin{frame}{Gauss-Jordan Elimination}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notice that we have not yet needed row operations of type III.
\item They are not used in Gaussian elimination.
\item They are needed in Gauss-Jordan elimination.
\item Gauss-Jordan elimination is an extension of Gaussian elimination that
offers an alternative to back-substituion.
\item The idea is that instead of doing back-substittion we continue to
perform elementary row-operations on the augmented matrix $(\Aprime \vert \bb^{\prime})$
until we have converted $\Aprime$ to the identity matrix $I$.
\item That is, we keep doing row operations until we arrive at the augmented
matrix $(I \vert \bb^{\prime\prime})$.
\item At this point we don't need to perform any back-substituion because $\bb^{\prime\prime}$
is the result.
\item This technique can only succeed if the original matrix is invertible.
\end{itemize}
