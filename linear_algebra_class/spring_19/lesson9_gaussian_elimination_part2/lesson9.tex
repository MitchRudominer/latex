\begin{frame}{Gaussian elimination: The Non-Simple Case}

\begin{itemize}
\item In the last lesson we learned the simple case of Gaussian elimination.
\item We start with a square matrix $A$.
\item After applying a series of row operations we transform $A$
into a new matrix $\Aprime$ that is upper-triangular with non-zeros on the diagonal.
\item This happens when our original matrix $A$ is a square invertible matrix.
\item But what if this is not the case?
\item What if $A$ is not invertible, or not even square?
\item Then we end up with a matrix $\Aprime$ in a slightly more complicated form.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Row-Echelon Form}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $A = \left(\bv_1 \vert \bv_2 \vert \cdots \vert \bv_n\right)$
be an $m\times n$ matrix with columns $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$.
\item Then $A$ is in \emph{row-echelon form} iff it follows these rules:
\item Let $\bv_f$ be the first non-zero column
\item Then $\bv_f$ has a non-zero in position 1 and zeros
in all other positions.
\item Now for each $i>=f$, if $\bv_i\not=\bzero$, let $k_i$ be the largest index of a non-zero entry in $\bv_i$.
\item Then $k_i<=\max \setof{k_j}{j<i} +1$.
\item If $k_i=\max \setof{k_j}{j<i} +1$ then $\bv_i$ is called a pivot column and the $k_i^{\text{th}}$ element
of $\bv_i$ is called a pivot.
\item Otherwise $k_i<= \max \setof{k_j}{j<i}$ and $\bv_i$ is called a non-pivot column.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The bolded columns are called the \emph{pivot} columns. The red entries are the pivots.
\item The pivots must all be non-zero.
\item There must be zeros below the pivots.
\item Above the pivots can be anything.
\item The first pivot is the first entry of the first pivot column.
\item The second pivot is the second entry of the second pivot column. Etc.
\item The non-pivot columns must have zeros below the pivot column immediately to the left.

\begin{frame}{Gaussian elimination}

\begin{itemize}
\item Given any rectangular matrix $A$, we can perform Gaussian elimination on it.
\item This yields another matrix $\Aprime$ of the same size that is in row-echelon form.
\item This is a generalization of the simple case we learned in the previous lesson.

\begin{frame}{Gaussian elimination Algorithm by Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use Gaussian elimination to bring the following matrix to row-echelon
form.

0 & 1  &  17  & -11  &  0  &  1  \\

0 & -1 &  -17   &  6 &  3  &  1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
\item First skip any all-zero columns on the left.
\item Start working with the first non-zero column. In our case that is column 2.
\item This will be the first pivot column.
\item We need a non-zero entry in the first position of the first pivot column.
\item Currently we have a 0 in the first position.
\item We have to perform a swap in order to put a nonzero there. (An elementary row operation of type II)
\item Swap rows 1 and 2

\item Now we need to find the next pivot column. Look for the
next column with a nonzero below the first pivot.

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $A\bx=\bb$ is a general system of linear equations.
\item Recall that the possibilities for the solution set are:
\item (i) There are no solutions. The system is incompatible (or inconsistent.)
\item This happens when $\bb\notin\ran(T_A)$.
\item (ii) There is exactly one solution.
\item This happens when $\bb\in\ran(T_A)$  and $T_A$ is one-to-one ( $\ker(A)$ is trivial).
\item (iii) There are infinitely many solutions.
\item This happens when $\bb\in\ran(T_A)$  and $T_A$ is not one-to-one ( $\ker(A)$ is not trivial).
\item If $A$ is in row-echelon form then it is easy to see which of these three cases occur.

\begin{frame}{Incompatible systems}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $A\bx=\bb$ is a general system of linear equations, and $A$ is in row-echelon form.
\item Then the system is incompatible iff
\item there is a row of $A$ that is all zeros but the corresponding component of $\bb$ is not zero.
\item Example:
$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 5 & 6 \\

\begin{frame}{Unique solutions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $A\bx=\bb$ is a general system of linear equations, and $A$ is in row-echelon form.
\item Then the system has a unique solution iff
\item $A$ is  upper triangular with nonzeros on the diagonal,
\item with all zero rows at the bottom allowed as long as the corresponding components of $\bb$ are also zero.
\item Example:
$$
A =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
0 & 0 & 8 & 9 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\

\quad
\bb=
