\begin{frame}{Rank of a matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix.
\item The span of the columns of $A$ is called the \emph{column space} of $A$.
\item Recall that $T_A:\R^n\map\R^m$
\item and that the range (or image) of $T_A$ is equal to the column space of $A$.
\item \textbf{Definition.} The \emph{rank} of $A$, written $\rank(A)$,
is the dimension of the column space of $A$.\
\item Equivalently, the dimension of the image of $T_A$.
\item Equivalently, the size of a maximal linearly independent subset of
the columns of $A$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example of rank}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find the rank of $A$.
\item $A=
\begin{pmatrix}
1  & 0  & 1 \\
0  & 1  & 3 \\
2  & 0  & 2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item The first two columns are linearly independent but the third column
is a linear combination of the first two columns.
\item So $\rank(A) = 2$.
\item And the first two columns are a basis for the column space.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example 2 of rank}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find the rank of $A$.
\item $A=
\begin{pmatrix}
-3  & 2  & 1 \\
0   & 1  & 3 \\
0   & 0  & 2 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$.
\item The three columns are linearly independent. We know this because the
matrix is upper-triangular with nonzeros on the diagonal.
\item So $\rank(A) = 3$.
\item And all three columns form a basis for the column space.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The basic columns of a matrix}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $A = \left(\bv_1 \vert \bv_2 \vert \cdots \vert \bv_n\right)$
be an $m\times n$ matrix with columns $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$.
\item The \emph{basic} columns of $A$ are defined as follows:
\item If $A$ is the zero matrix then it has no basic columns.
\item Let $\bv_f$ be the first nonzero column. Then $\bv_f$ is the first basic column.
\item So for example if $\bv_1\not=\bzero$ then $\bv_1 = \bv_f$ is the first basic column.
\item For $i>f$, $\bv_i$ is a basic column iff it is not in the span of the earlier columns.
\item i.e $\bv_i$ is a basic column iff $\bv_i\notin\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_{i-i})$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The basic columns are a maximal linearly independent set}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $A = \left(\bv_1 \vert \bv_2 \vert \cdots \vert \bv_n\right)$
be an $m\times n$ matrix with columns $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$.
\item Let $\bv_{i_1},\bv_{i_2},\cdots,\bv_{i_r}$ be the $r$ basic columns of $A$.
\item Then $\singleton{\bv_{i_1},\bv_{i_2},\cdots,\bv_{i_r}}$ is a maximal linearly independent
subset of the columns of $A$.
\item So $\rank(A) = r$
\item and $\singleton{\bv_{i_1},\bv_{i_2},\cdots,\bv_{i_r}}$ form a basis for the
column space of $A$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The basic columns are a maximal linearly independent set}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{proof.} $\singleton{\bv_{i_1},\bv_{i_2},\cdots,\bv_{i_r}}$ is linearly
independent:
\item Suppose $c_1\bv_{i_1} + c_2\bv_{i_2} + \cdots + c_r \bv_{i_r} = 0$.
\item Let $k$ be greatest such that $c_k\not=0$.
\item So $c_1\bv_{i_1} + c_2\bv_{i_2} + \cdots + c_k \bv_{i_k} = 0$.
\item Then we could divide by $c_k$ and solve for $\bv_{i_k}$.
\item $\bv_{i_k} = -(c_1/c_k)\bv_{i_1} -(c_2/c_k)\bv_{i_2} \cdots -(c_{k-1}/c_k)\bv_{i_{k-1}}$.
\item So we have expressed $\bv_{i_k}$ as a linear combination of the earlier $\bv_i$.
\item But by definition of $\bv_{i_k}$ it is not in the span of the earlier columns. $\diamondsuit$
\item $\singleton{\bv_{i_1},\bv_{i_2},\cdots,\bv_{i_r}}$ is maximal:
\item Every other
column was not chosen to be a basic column because it is in the span of the
earlier columns. So throwing it in would give us a linearly dependent set. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let
$$A = \left(\bv_1 \vert \bv_2 \vert \bv_3 \vert \bv_4 \vert \bv_5 \right) =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
\item $\bv_1 = \bzero$ is not a basic column.
\item $\bv_2
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
is the first basic column.
\item $\bv_3 =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
1 \\
0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
is not a multiple of $\bv_2$ so it is the second basic column.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example continued}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have
$$A = \left(\bv_1 \vert \bv_2 \vert \bv_3 \vert \bv_4 \vert \bv_5 \right) =
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
\item $\bv_4
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
1 \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
is in the span of $\bv_2,\bv_3$ so it is not a basic column.
\item $\bv_5
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$
is not in the span of $\bv_2,\bv_3$ so it is the third basic column.
\item So the basic columns of $A$ are $\bv_2,\bv_3,\bv_5$.
\item So these form a basis for the column space of $A$
\item and $\rank(A) = 3$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Special forms of matrices}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some matrices are in a form where it is easy to read off information
about them, such as their rank.
\item For example, we have already seen upper-triangular matrices with
nonzeros on the diagonal.
\item We will now study a generalization of this form called \emph{row-echelon} form.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Row-Echelon Form}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Definition.} Let $A = \left(\bv_1 \vert \bv_2 \vert \cdots \vert \bv_n\right)$
be an $m\times n$ matrix with columns $\bv_1,\bv_2,\cdots,\bv_n$.
\item Then $A$ is in \emph{row-echelon form} iff it follows these rules:
\item Let $\bv_f$ be the first non-zero column
\item Then $\bv_f$ has a non-zero in position 1 and zeros
in all other positions.
\item Now for each $i>=f$, if $\bv_i\not=\bzero$, let $k_i$ be the largest index of a non-zero entry in $\bv_i$.
\item Then $k_i<=\max \setof{k_j}{j<i} +1$.
\item If $k_i=\max \setof{k_j}{j<i} +1$ then $\bv_i$ is called a pivot column and the $k_i^{\text{th}}$ element
of $\bv_i$ is called a pivot.
\item Otherwise $k_i<= \max \setof{k_j}{j<i}$ and $\bv_i$ is called a non-pivot column.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The bolded columns are called the \emph{pivot} columns. The red entries are the pivots.
\item The pivots must all be non-zero.
\item There must be zeros below the pivots.
\item Above the pivots can be anything.
\item The first pivot is the first entry of the first pivot column.
\item The second pivot is the second entry of the second pivot column. Etc.
\item The non-pivot columns must have zeros below the pivot column immediately to the left.

\end{pmatrix}
$
\begin{itemize}
\item The pivot columns are linearly independent.
\item One way to see this is to notice that if we pull out only the pivot columns
we can add additional columns to form a matrix in upper-triangular form with all zeros on the diagonal.

\item Notice that $\be_3\in\spn(\be_1,\be_2,\bv_5)=\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_5)$.
\item So $\spn(\bv_1,\bv_2,\bv_5) = \spn(\be_1,\be_2,\be_3)$.
\item In general the span of the first $k$ pivot columns is equal to the
span of the first $k$ standard basis vectors $\be_1,\be_2,\cdots,\be_k$.
