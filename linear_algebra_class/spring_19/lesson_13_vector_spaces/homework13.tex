\maketitle

\textbf{Read:} the introduction to Chapter 2 and sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the textbook.
Note that the textbook gives other examples of vector spaces. This may be interesting
for you to see, but you will not be responsible for that material. In this class
we will be focused only on the vector spaces $\R^n$ and subspaces of $\R^n$.
In particular you will not be responsible for any material on \emph{function spaces.}

\textbf{Problem 1.} Let $V$ be a vector space. True or false? Explain. It is possible
that in addition to the zero vector $\bzero$ there is a second vector $\bv\in V$,
$\bv\not=\bzero$,
such that $\bv$ is also an additive identity. This means that for all
vectors $\bw\in V$, $\bw + \bv = \bw$.
