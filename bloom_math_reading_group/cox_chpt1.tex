\begin{frame}{Polynomials in several variables}


\begin{itemize}
  \item Theme: Polynomials in several variables are harder to work with than polynomials in one variable.
  \item Polynomial in one variable: $7x^3 + 2x - 1$.
  \item Polynomial in several variables: $7x^3y - 3y^2z^2 + xyz -2x - 4$.
  \item In this session will study some abstract algebra to understand the difference between polynomials in one variable vs several variables.
  \item It will boil down to this: In one variable we have the Euclidean algorithm and B\'{e}zout's identity. In several variables we do not.
  \item In the next session we will study Gr\"{o}bner bases.
  \item This is a computational tool to allow us to work with several variables despite the fact that we don't have the Euclidean algorithm and B\'{e}zout's identity.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ring Theory}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{ring} is an algebraic structure with two operations: addition and multiplication.
  \item The operations are associative and commutative and multiplication distributes over addition.
  \item There is an element $0$ that is an additive identity and an element $1$ that is a multiplicative identity.
  \item We don't necessarily have division.
  \item To be precise this is a \emph{commutative ring with unit}. But we will call it a ring.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Examples of Rings}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Z$, the set of integers, with addition and multiplication.
  \item $\Z_n$, the set of integers mod $n$, with addition and multiplication mod $n$.
  \item $\R[x]$, the set of polynomials in one variable with real coefficients, with addition and multiplication of polynomials.
  \item $\R[x,y,z]$, the set of polynomials in three variables with real coefficients, with addition and multiplication of polynomials.
  \item $\Z[\alpha]$. Here $\alpha$ is some fixed complex number. The ring consists of all complex numbers of the form $a+b\alpha$ where
  $a,b\in\Z$.
  \item A \textbf{field} is a ring where we also have division.
  \item Examples of fields: $\Q, \R, \C$.
  \item $\Z_p$ where $p$ is prime is a field.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Units}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition} Let $R$ be a ring. An element $u\in R$ is called a \textbf{unit} iff there is a $v\in R$ such that $uv=1$.
  \item Here we write $1$ to mean the unique multiplicative identity element of $R$.
  \item i.e a unit is an element that has a multiplicative inverse.
  \item Examples: In $\Z$ the only units are $1$ and $-1$.
  \item In $\Z_{10}$, $3\times 7 = 1$. So $3$ and $7$ are multiplicative inverses. So $3$ and $7$ are units.
  \item In $\Z_{10}$, there is no $x$ such that $4\times x = 1$. So $4$ is not a unit.
  \item In $\R[x]$ and $\R[x,y,z]$ the only units are the polynomials of degree zero, i.e. the real numbers.
  \item \textbf{Definition} A \textbf{field} is a ring in which all non-zero elements are units.
  \item $\Q, \R, \C$ are fields.
  \item $\Z_p$, where $p$ is prime, is a field.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Zero-divisors}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition} Let $R$ be a ring. An element $a\not=0\in R$ is called a \textbf{zero-divisor} iff there is a $b\not=0\in R$ such that $ab=0$.
  \item \textbf{Definition} An \textbf{integral domain} is a ring that has no zero-divisors.
  \item All of our example rings are Integral Domains except $\Z_n$ where $n$ is not prime.
  \item For example in $\Z_{10}$, $4\times 5 = 0$. So $4$ and $5$ are zero-divisors and $\Z_{10}$ is not an integral domain.
  \item In all of our other examples, if $a,b\not=0$ then $ab \not = 0$.
  \item For example, the product of two non-zero polynomials is non-zero.
  \item An element cannot be both a zero-divisor and a unit. So a field is an integral domain.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Cancellation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lemma} Let $R$ be an integral domain. Suppose $a\not=0$ and $ab = ac$.
  \item Then $b=c$.
  \item \textbf{proof}. $ab - ac = 0$ so $a(b-c) = 0$.
  \item Since $a\not=0$ and $R$ is an integral domain, $b-c=0$, so $b=c$. $\qed$.
  \item Notice in $\Z_{10}$ we do not have cancellation.
  \item $4\times 7 = 4 \times 2$, but $7\not= 2$.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Irreducible Elements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition} Let $R$ be an integral domain. An element $a\not=0\in R$ is called  \textbf{irreducible} iff it is not possible to write $a=bc$ where
  $b$ and $c$ are both non-units.
  \item Examples: In $\Z$ $a$ is irreducible iff it is a prime number. For example $6$ is not irreducible because $6=2\times 3$ and $2$ and $3$ are not units.
  \item In $\Z$, $2$ is irreducible because if $2=ab$ then either $a=\pm1$ or $=\pm1$.
  \item In $\R[x]$ the irreducibles are the polynomials that cannot be factored into the product of two polynomials of degree greater than zero.
  \item For example $2x^2 + 2$ is irreducible. $2x^2 + 2 = 2 (x^2 + 1)$. But $2$ is a unit in $\R[x]$.
  \item In $\C[x]$, $2x^2+2$ is not irreducible because $2x^2+2= 2(x+i)(x-i)$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Associates}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition} Let $R$ be an integral domain. Two elements $a,b$ are called \textbf{associates} iff there is a unit $u$ such that $a=ub$.
  \item Examples: In $\Z$, $5$ and $-5$ are associates because $-1$ is a unit.
  \item In $\R[x]$, $x^2+1$ and $3x^2 +3$ are associates because $3$ is a unit.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Unique Factorization Domains}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition} A Unique Factorization Domain, or \textbf{UFD} is an integral domain in which every non-zero element can be factored into a product of irreducibles and units, and the the factorization is unique, up to order of the factors and associates.
  \item Examples: $\Z$ is a unique factorization domain. (The fundamental theorem of arithmetic.)
  \item $18 = 3^2 \times 2$, $3$ and $2$ are irreducible.
  \item ``up to order of the factors and associates": $18 = (-2)(-3) (3)$.
  \item A field is trivially a UFD since all non-zero elements are units.
  \item Example of an integral domain that is not a UFD: $\Z[\sqrt{-5}]$.
  \item $6 = 2\times 3 = (1+\sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5})$.
  \item $2,3,(1+\sqrt{-5}),(1-\sqrt{-5})$ are all irreducible.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Polynomial Rings}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition} If $R$ is any ring then $R[x]$ is the ring of polynomials in the variable $x$ with coefficients in $R$.
  \item \textbf{Theorem} If $R$ is a UFD then so is $R[x]$.
  \item \textbf{Corollary} $\R[x]$ is a UFD.
  \item $4x^2 -4 = 4(x-1)(x+1)$. $4$ is a unit. $(x-1),(x+1)$ are irreducible.
  \item ``up to order of the factors and associates": $4x^2 -4 = (2x-2)(2x+2)$
  \item \textbf{Corollary} $\R[x,y,z]$ is a UFD.
  \item \textbf{proof:} $\R[x,y,z] = \left( (\R[x])[y] \right ) [z]$. $\qed$
  \item $x^2yz +xy +xz +1 = (xy+1)(xz+1)$
  \item $(xy+1), (xz+1)$ are irreducible.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{GCDs}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $R$ is a ring and $a,d\in R$ we say that $d$ \emph{divides} $a$, or $d$ is a \emph{divisor} of $a$, or $a$ is a \emph{multiple} of $d$ iff
  \item there is a $b\in R$ such that $a=db$.
  \item Examples: In $\Z$, $6$ is a divisor of $30$ because $30 = 6\times 5$.
  \item In $\R[x]$, $(x+1)$ is a divisor of $x^2-1$ because $x^2-1 = (x+1)(x-1)$.
  \item If $d$ divides $a$ and $d$ divides $b$ then $d$ is a \emph{common divisor} of $a$ and $b$.
  \item \textbf{Definition} Suppose $R$ is an integral domain. $d$ is a \emph{greatest common divisor} of $a$ and $b$ iff $d$ is a
  common divisor of $a$ and $b$ and whenever $c$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$, $c$ divides $d$.
  We write $d=\gcd(a,b)$.
  \item If $\gcd(a,b)$ exists it is unique up to associates. If $d=\gcd(a,b)$ and $e=\gcd(a,b)$ then $d$ and $e$ are associates.
  \item \textbf{proof.} $d$ and $e$ divide each other. This is equivalent to $d$ and $e$ being associates. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{More GCDs. Relatively Prime}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In $\Z$, $6 = \gcd(30, 42)$. (Technically also $-6=\gcd(30,42)$ but nobody would write this.)
  \item In $\R[x]$, $(x+1) = \gcd(x^2-1, x^2+2x+1)$. Also $2(x+1)= \gcd(x^2-1, x^2+2x+1)$.
  \item If $\gcd(a,b) = 1$ then we say that $a$ and $b$ are \emph{relatively prime.}
  \item Examples: In $\Z$, $9$ and $10$ are relatively prime because $\gcd(9,10) = 1$.
  \item In $\R[x]$, $x^2-1$ and $x^2 -4$ are relatively prime.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{GCDs in UFDs}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} If $R$ is a UFD then for all $a,b\in R$, $\gcd(a,b)$ exists.
  \item \textbf{Idea of proof:} $360 = 2^3  \cdot 3^2  \cdot 5$.
  \item $756 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 7$.
  \item $\gcd(360,756) = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 = 36$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Linear Combinations and the B\'{e}zout Property}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $R$ be a ring and $a,b\in R$. An $R$-linear combination of $a$ and $b$ is an element of $R$ of the form
  $xa+yb$ where $x,y\in R$.
  \item Examples: In $\Z$, $32$ is a linear combination of $6$ and $10$ because $32 = (7)6 + (-1)10$.
  \item In $\R[x,y]$, $x^2 + x + y^2 +y$ is a linear combination of $x$ and $y$ because it is equal to $(x+1)x + (y+1)y$.
  \item We extend the definition of linear combination also to more than two elements.
  \item A ring $R$ has the B\'{e}zout Property iff for all $a,b\in R$, $\gcd(a,b)$ exists and $\gcd(a,b)$ is an $R$-linear
  combination of $a$ and $b$.
  \item B\'{e}zout's formula: $\gcd(a,b) = xa + yb$, for some $x,y\in R$.
  \item Example: $\Z$ has the B\'{e}zout Property: For example $\gcd(6,10) = 2$ and $2=(2)6 - 10$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{$R[x,y]$ and the B\'{e}zout Property}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Later we will show that $\Z$ and $\R[x]$ have the B\'{e}zout Property.
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} $\R[x,y]$ does not have the the B\'{e}zout Property.
  \item \textbf{proof.} $\gcd(x,y) = 1$.
  \item This is clear because the divisors of $x$ are $r$ and $rx$ with $r\in\R$.
  \item Similarly the divisors of $y$ are $r$ and $ry$ with $r\in\R$.
  \item So the only common divisors of $x$ and $y$ are the units.
  \item But $1$ is not a linear combination of $x$ and $y$.
  \item Suppose $f,g\in\R[x,y]$ and consider $fx + gy$.
  \item Every term of that polynomial is either divisible by $x$ or divisible by $y$.
  \item So there are no non-zero constant terms. So it cannot equal $1$. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Ideals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition.} Let $R$ be a ring and $I\subset R$. Then $I$ is an \emph{ideal} iff
  \item (a) $0\in I$
  \item (b) Whenever $x,y\in I$, $x+y\in I$.
  \item (c) Whenever $x\in I$ and $y\in R$, $xy\in I$.
  \item \textbf{Definition.} Let $a_1,a_2,\cdots a_n \in R$. Then the \emph{ideal generated by} $a_1,a_2,\cdots a_n$ is the set
  of linear combinations of $a_1,a_2,\cdots a_n$. This is written $(a_1,a_2, \cdots a_n)$.
  \item Check that this is an ideal.
  \item Example: In $Z[x,y]$ consider the ideal $(x,y)$. This is the set of polynomials in $x$ and $y$ with zero constant term.
  \item \textbf{Definition.} Let $I$ be an ideal. $I$ is called \emph{finitely generated} iff $I=(a_1,\cdots, a_n)$.
  \item In this
  case $a_1,\cdots, a_n$ are called \emph{generators} for $I$ or a \emph{basis} for $I$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Principal Ideal Domains}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition.} Let $R$ be a ring. An ideal $I$ is called \emph{principal} iff it is generated by a single element, i.e.
  $I=(a)$ for some $a\in R$.
  \item Notice that $(a)$ is the set of multiples of $a$. For example in $\Z$, $(2)$ is the set of even numbers.
  \item \textbf{Definition.} An integral domain $R$ is called a \emph{principal ideal domain} or PID iff every ideal of $R$ is principal.
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} $\Z$ is a PID.
  \item \textbf{proof.} Let $I$ be an ideal of $\Z$. Let $a$ be the least positive element of $I$. We claim that $I=(a)$.
  \item Trivially $(a) \subseteq I$. So we need to show that $I \subseteq (a)$, that is that every element of $I$ is a multiple of $a$.
  \item Let $b\in I$. We want to see that $b$ is a multiple of $a$.
  \item If $b$ is not a multiple of $a$ then $b=qa+r$ with a remainder $r$ such that $0<r <a$.
  \item But $b\in I$ and $a\in I$ and $r = b -qa$ so $r\in I$. But $a$ was chosen to be the least positive element of $I$. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{$\R[x]$ is a Principal Ideal Domain}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} $\R[x]$ is a PID.
  \item \textbf{proof.} Let $I$ be an ideal of $\R[x]$. If $I = \singleton{0}$ then $I=(0)$ is principal. So suppose $I\not=\singleton{0}$.
  \item Let $f\in I$ be a non-zero element of smallest degree. We claim that $I=(f)$.
  \item Trivially $(f) \subseteq I$. So we need to show that $I \subseteq (f)$, that is that every element of $I$ is a multiple of $f$.
  \item Let $g\in I$. We want to see that $g$ is a multiple of $f$.
  \item If $g$ is not a multiple of $f$ then $g=qf+r$ with a remainder $r$ such that $\deg(r) < \deg(f)$.
  \item $g\in I$ and $f\in I$ and $r=g-qf$. So $r\in I$.
  \item But $f$ was chosen to have the smallest degree of any non-zero polynomial in $I$.
  \item So we must have $r=0$. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{PIDs and B\'{e}zout Property}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $R$ be a PID. Then $R$ has the B\'{e}zout Property.
  \item \textbf{proof.}  Let $a,b\in R$. We need to show that $\gcd(a,b)$ exists and also that $\gcd(a,b)$
  can be written as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.
  \item Consider the ideal $(a,b)$. Since $R$ is a PID, this ideal is principal. So let $d$ be an element
  such that $(a,b) = (d)$.
  \item Since $d\in(a,b)$, $d$ is a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.
  \item So it suffices to see that $d=\gcd(a,b)$.
  \item Since $a,b \in (d)$, $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
  \item Suppose $c$ is also a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Then $a,b\in (c)$.
  \item Then $(d) = (a,b) \subset (c)$.
  \item So $d\in (c)$. So $c$ divides $d$.
  \item So $d=\gcd(a,b)$. \qed
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{$\R[x,y]$ is not a PID}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Corollary.} $\R[x,y]$ is not a PID.
  \item \textbf{proof.} Previously we showed that $\R[x,y]$ does not have the B\'{e}zout Property.$\qed$
  \item In fact our previous proof showed that in $\R[x,y]$ the ideal $(x,y)$ is not principal.
  \item This is because $\gcd(x,y) = 1$. So if $(x,y)$ were principal we would have to have $(x,y) = (1) = \R[x,y]$.
  \item But $(x,y)$ is the set of polynomials with zero constant term so it is not all of $\R[x,y]$.

\begin{frame}{Quotient and Remainder}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $a,b\in\Z$, $b\not=0$.
  \item Then there exists unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that
  \item $a = qb +r$ and $0\leq r < b$.
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $f,g\in\R[x]$, $g\not=0$.
  \item Then there exists polynomials $q,r\in\R[x]$ such that
  \item $f = qg +r$ and $0\leq \deg(r) < \deg(b)$.
  \item $q$ and $r$ are unique up to multiplication by constants.
  \item Notice the difference between the two theorems is in the function we used to measure the size of the remainder.
  \item In the case of $\Z$ it was $|r|$ and in the case of $\R[x]$ it was $\deg(r)$.
  \item A \emph{Euclidean Domain} is an integral domain where we can define an appropriate function like those and then have a similar quotient and remainder theorem. We will skip the precise definition.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Euclidean Domains}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} $\Z$ and $\R[x]$ are both Euclidean domains.
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} A Euclidean domain is a PID.
  \item \textbf{proof sketch.} If you look at our earlier proofs that $\Z$ and $\R[x]$
  are PIDs, you will see that in both cases all we used is the quotient and remainder property
  that comes from them being Euclidean domains.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The Euclidean Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $R$ be a Euclidean domain.
  \item Let $a,b \in R$.
  \item Since $R$ is a PID, $\gcd(a,b)$ exists and there are $x,y\in R$ such that $\gcd(a,b) = xa + yb$.
  \item Additionally, because we have a quotient and remainder theorem, there is an efficient algorithm for
  computing $\gcd(a,b)$ and for computing $x,y$.
  \item The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient algorithm for computing $\gcd(a,b)$.
  \item The extended Euclidean algorithm is an efficient algorithm for computing $x,y$.
  \item The algorithm involves repeatedly reducing the problem to a smaller problem by taking remainders.
