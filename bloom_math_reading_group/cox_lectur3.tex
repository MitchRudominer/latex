\begin{frame}{Varieties}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A quick detour into the geometric side of algebraic geometry.
  \item We proved that $\R[x,y,z]$ is Noetherian so every ideal is finitely generated.
  \item But the problem is that we have not given any examples of ideals besides $(f_1,\cdots, f_n)$. These are obviously finitely generated,
  so the Hilbert Basis Theorem is not that interesting yet.
  \item I want to give more examples of ideals and getting a little bit into algebraic geometry is a good way to do that.
  \item \textbf{Definition.} Let $f_1,\cdots f_n \in \R[x,y,z]$. Then the \emph{variety} of $f_1,\cdots f_n$ is
  \item $\mathbf{V}(f_1,\cdots,f_n) = \setof{p\in\R^3}{f_1(p)=0 \text{ and } f_2(p)=0 \text{ and } \cdots f_n(p)=0}$.
  \item This is a surface in $\R^3$ or a curve or a finite set of points or the empty set or all of $\R^3$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{More abut Varieties}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathbf{V}(z-x^2-y^2)$ is a paraboloid of revolution.
  \item $\mathbf{V}(x,y,z)$ is the origin.
  \item $\mathbf{V}(x^2-1,y^2-1,z^2-1)$ consists of eight points.
  \item $\mathbf{V}(x,y)$ is the $z$-axis
  \item $\mathbf{V}(x^2 - 1,x^2 - 2)$ is the empty set
  \item $\mathbf{V}(1)$ is the empty set
  \item $\mathbf{V}(0)$ is all of $\R^3$.
  \item The union and the intersection of two varieties is a variety.
  \item In general, if someone gives us a list of polynomials, it is not trivial to look at the polynomials and
  answer questions about the variety of those polynomials.
  \item e.g. Is the variety infinite? If so what is its dimension?
  \item Is the variety finite? If so what is its cardinality?

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Varieties and Ideals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $I$ be an ideal of $\R[x,y,z]$. The variety of $I$ is
  \item $\mathbf{V}(I) = \setof{p\in\R^3}{f(p)=0\text{ for all } f\in I}$.
  \item \textbf{Claim.} $\mathbf{V}(f_1,\cdots,f_n) = \mathbf{V}(I)$ where $I = (f_1,\cdots,f_n)$.
  \item In other words, the variety of a set of polynomials is the same as the variety of the ideal generated by those polynomials.
  So we should really think about varieties as being associated with ideals as opposed to being associated with a particular finite list of polynomials.
  \item \textbf{proof of claim.} Let $p\in\R^3$.
  \item $p\in \mathbf{V}(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ iff $f_1(p) = \cdots = f_n(p) = 0$.
  \item $p\in \mathbf{V}(I)$ iff $f(p)=0$ whenever $f=c_1f_1 + c_2f_2 + \cdots + c_nf_n$ for any values of $c_1,\cdots,c_n$.
  \item These two are obviously equivalent. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{The Ideal of a Variety}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition.} Let $\mathbf{V}$ be a variety.
  \item The \emph{ideal of  $\mathbf{V}$} is $I(\mathbf{V}) = \setof{f\in\R[x,y,z]}{f(p) = 0 \, \forall p \in \mathbf{V}}$.
  \item Let $I$ be any ideal of $\R[x,y,z]$. Then $I\subset I(\mathbf{V}(I))$.
  \item In general $I\not= I(\mathbf{V}(I))$.
  \item \textbf{Why?} Let $I\subset\R[x,y,z]$ be an ideal. Suppose $f^2\in I$ but $f\not\in I$.
  \item If $f^2(p)=0$ then $f(p)=0$.
  \item So $f\in I(\mathbf{V}(I))$ but $f\notin I$.
  \item $I(\mathbf{V}(I))$ is not presented to us in terms of a finite number of generators.
  \item So here is an example of an ideal that is not obviously finitely generated.
  \item Hilbert's Basis Theorem tells us it is finitely generated though.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Varieties and Gr\"{o}bner bases}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $(f_1,\cdots,f_n) = (g_1,\cdots,g_m)$ then $\mathbf{V}(f_1,\cdots,f_n) = \mathbf{V}(g_1,\cdots,g_m)$.
  \item i.e. Given $f_1,\cdots,f_n$, if we want to answer some questions about $\mathbf{V}(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$,
  we can replace $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ with a different basis for the same ideal, $g_1,\cdots,g_m$, and use
  $g_1,\cdots,g_m$ to answer questions about the variety.
  \item It turns out that a Gr\"{o}bner basis is a good basis to use for understanding ideals.
  \item This explains why Gr\"{o}bner bases are useful in algebraic geometry and gives another motivation for studying Gr\"{o}bner bases.
  \item If $g_1,\cdots,g_m$ is a Gr\"{o}bner then it is easier to look at $g_1,\cdots,g_m$ and answer those questions I mentioned earlier
  about $\mathbf{V}(g_1,\cdots,g_m)$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $I$ be an ideal of $\R[x,y,z]$ and $g\in\R[x,y,z]$.
  \item There is a unique $f\in I$ and a unique $r\in\R[x,y,z]$ such that
  \item $g = f + r$  and
  \item \textbf{unique remainder property:} Each term of $r$ is not divisible by the leading term of any polynomial in $I$.
  \item Note how this generalizes the unique remainders in $\R[x]$.
  \item Example: $x^3 + x^2 + 2 = (x+1)(x^2+1) + ( -x + 1)$.
  \item unique remainder property: $\deg(-x+1) < 2$.

\begin{frame}{Monomial Orderings}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The unique remainder property for $\R[x,y,z]$ involves \emph{leading terms}. But which is the leading term?
  \item Lex: $x^4yz^2 + x^3y^3z^2 + x^2y^5z$
  \item GrLex: $x^3y^3z^2 + x^2y^5z + x^4yz^2$
  \item GRevLex: $x^2y^5z +x^3y^3z^2 +  x^4yz^2$
  \item \textbf{Definition} A \emph{monomial ordering} for $\R[x,y,z]$ is a
  well-ordering $<$ of 3-tuples of non-negative integers such that $\alpha < \beta \Implies \alpha + \gamma < \beta + \gamma$
  \item A monomial ordering on 3-tuples of exponents $\alpha=(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ naturally gives us an ordering on
  monomials $u = x^{\alpha_0}y^{\alpha_1}z^{\alpha_2}$ with the property that $u<v \Implies uw < vw$.
  \item All discussions of leading terms and Gr\"{o}bner bases are relative to some fixed choice of a monomial ordering.
  \item We'll use GrLex for the remainder of this presentation.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Monomial Ideals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition.} A \emph{monomial ideal} is an ideal $I=(u_1,\cdots, u_n)$ such that $u_1,\cdots,u_n$ are monomials.
  \item \textbf{Monomial Ideal Lemma.} Let $I=(u_1,\cdots, u_n)$ be the monomial ideal generated by monomials $u_1,\cdots,u_n$.
  \item Then every term of every polynomial in $I$ is divisible by one of the $u_i$.
  \item \textbf{proof.}  Let $w_1,\cdots,w_m$ be the monomials of $f$ so that $f=c_1w_1 + \cdots c_m w_m$ where the $c_i$ are constants.
  \item We need to see that every $w_i$ is divisible by one of $u_1,\cdots,u_n$.
  \item Because $f\in (u_1,\cdots, u_n)$ we have $f=h_1u_1 + \cdots + h_n u_n$ for some $h_1,\cdots,h_n\in\R[x,y,z]$.
  \item So we have $c_1w_1 + \cdots + c_m w_m = h_1u_1 + \cdots + h_n u_n$.
  \item After multiplying out and collecting terms, all of the terms on the right hand side are divisible by one of the $u_i$.
  So the same must be true on the left-hand-side. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Leading Term Ideal}

\begin{itemize}
  \item If $f\in\R[x,y,z]$ we write $\LT(f)$ for the leading term of $f$ and $\LM(f)$ for the leading monomial of $f$.
  \item \textbf{Definition.}  Let $I$ be an ideal of $\R[x,y,z]$. Then the \emph{leading term ideal of $I$} is
  \item $\LT(I) = $ the ideal generated by $\setof{\LT(f)}{f\in I}$.
  \item Equivalently $\LT(I) = $ the ideal generated by $\setof{\LM(f)}{f\in I}$.
  \item So $\LT(I)$ is a monomial ideal.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Unique Remainder Theorem using $\LT(I)$}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $I$ be an ideal of $\R[x,y,z]$ and $g\in\R[x,y,z]$.
  \item There is a unique $f\in I$ and a unique $r\in\R[x,y,z]$ such that
  \item $g = f + r$  and
  \item \textbf{unique remainder property:} Each term of $r$ is not in $\LT(I)$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{ Gr\"{o}bner Bases}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition.} $f_1,\cdots f_n $ is a Gr\"{o}bner basis iff
  \item for every non-zero $g\in (f_1,\cdots f_n)$, the leading term of $g$ is divisible
  by the leading term of one of $f_1,\cdots,f_n$.
  \item By the monomial ideal theorem, $f_1,\cdots f_n$ is a Gr\"{o}bner basis iff
  \item $\LT(f_1,\cdots,f_n) = (\LT(f_1),\cdots,\LT(f_n))$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Examples}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\singleton{x^2y+1, xy^2}$ is not a Gr\"{o}bner basis.
  \item \textbf{proof.} $y = y(x^2y+1) -x(xy^2)$, but $y$ is not divisible by $x^2y$ or $xy^2$.
  \item $\singleton{x^2 + 1, y^2 + 1}$ is a Gr\"{o}bner basis.
  \item Intuitively, there is no way to form a linear combination of $x^2 + 1$ and $y^2 + 1$
  in which the leading terms cancel as they did in the previous example. Every linear combination has the property that the leading term will either be divisible by $x^2$ or by $y^2$.
  \item $\singleton{x^2y, xy^2}$ is a Gr\"{o}bner basis. This follows from
  \item \textbf{Lemma.} Every set of monomials is a Gr\"{o}bner basis.
  \item This follows from the Monomial Ideal Lemma.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Gr\"{o}bner bases existence}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $I$ be an ideal of $\R[x,y,z]$. Then $I$ has a Gr\"{o}bner basis.
  \item \textbf{proof.} Since $\R[x,y,z]$ is Noetherian, Both $I$ and $\LT(I)$ are finitely-generated.
  \item Let $f_1,\cdots,f_n\in I$ be such
  \item $I = (f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ and
  \item $\LT(I) = (\LT(f_1),\cdots,\LT(f_n))$.
  \item Then $\LT(f_1,\cdots,f_n) = (\LT(f_1),\cdots,\LT(f_n))$.
  \item So $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ is a Gr\"{o}bner basis for $I$. $\qed$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proof of the Unique Remainder Theorem}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} Let $I$ be an ideal of $\R[x,y,z]$ and $g\in\R[x,y,z]$.
  \item There is a unique $f\in I$ and a unique $r\in\R[x,y,z]$ such that
  \item $g = f + r$  and each term of $r$ is not in $\LT(I)$.
  \item \textbf{proof.} Uniqueness is easy. Suppose $g = f_1 + r_1$ and $g = f_2 + r_2$ with $f_1,f_2\in I$ and $r_1$ and $r_2$ both having the remainder property.
  \item The leading term of $r_1 - r_2$ is a scalar multiple of one of the terms of $r_1$ or of $r_2$.
  \item So the leading term of $r_1 - r_2$ is not in $\LT(I)$.
  \item So $r_1 - r_2 \notin I$. Contradiction since $r_1 - r_2 = f_2 - f_1$.
  \item Uniqueness of $f\in I$ follows because $f=g-r$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Proof of the Unique Remainder Theorem: Existence}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For the proof of existence, pick $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ a Gr\"{o}bner basis for $I$.
  \item Then the existence of the unique remainder follows from
  \item \textbf{Theorem. (Division Algorithm)} Let $g, f_1,\cdots f_n \in \R[x,y,z]$.
  \item Then there are $r,h_1\cdots h_n\in\R[x,y,z]$ such that
  \item $g = h_1 f_1 + \cdots h_n f_n + r$ and
  \item each term of $r$ is not divisible by the leading term of any of $f_1,\cdots,f_n$.
  \item \textbf{proof.} We will describe an algorithm which we will produce the $h_1,\cdots h_n$ and $r$.
  \item Let $h_1^0 = \cdots = h_n^0 = 0$.
  \item Let $s^0 = g$. Let $r^0 = 0$.
  \item Then $g = h_1^0 f_1 + \cdots + h_n^0 f_n + s^0 + r^0$
  \item and (vacuously) every term of $r^0$ is not divisible by any of the leading terms of $f_1,\cdots, f_n$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Division Algorithm for $\R[x,y,z]$}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose we have $h_1^k, \cdots, h_n^k$ and $s^k$ and $r^k$ such that
  \item $g = h_1^k f_1 + \cdots + h_n^k f_n + s^k + r^k$
  \item and every term of $r^k$ is not divisible by any of the leading terms of $f_1,\cdots, f_n$.
  \item Step $k+1$ of the algorithm will produce $h_1^{k+1} , \cdots,  h_n^{k+1}$ and $s^{k+1}$ and $r^{k+1}$ such that
  \item $g = h_1^{k+1} f_1 + \cdots + h_n^{k+1} f_n + s^{k+1} + r^{k+1}$ and
  \item every term of $r^{k+1}$ is not divisible by any of the leading terms of $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ and
  \item the leading term of $s^{k+1}$ is less than the leading term of $s^k$ in the monomial ordering.
  \item Since the monomial ordering is a well-ordering, the algorithm must terminate with some $k$ such that $s^k = 0$.
  \item For this $k$ we have $g = h_1^k f_1 + \cdots + h_n^k f_n + r^k$ and we are done.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Step $k+1$ of the division algorithm algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $u$ be the leading term of $s_k$.
  \item If $u$ is not divisible by the leading term of any of $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ then we move $u$ from $s$ to $r$.
  \item We let $s^{k+1} = s^k - u$ and $r^{k+1} = r^k + u$ and $h_i^{k+1} = h_i^k$ for $i=1,\cdots,n$.
  \item Then our inductive hypothesis remains true:
  \item $g = h_1^{k+1} f_1 + \cdots + h_n^{k+1} f_n + s^{k+1} + r^{k+1}$ and
  \item every term of $r^{k+1}$ is not divisible by any of the leading terms of $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ and
  \item the leading term of $s^{k+1}$ is less than the leading term of $s^k$ in the monomial ordering since the leading
  term of $s^{k+1}$ is the second leading term of $s^k$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Step $k+1$ continued}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Now suppose that $u$ is divisible by the leading term of one of the $f_i$.
  \item For simplicity suppose $u$ is divisible by $v$, the leading term of $f_1$.
  \item We will move $u$ out of $s$ and into $h_1 f_1$.
  \item Write $u = vw$. We will add $w$ to $h_1$ and subtract terms from $s^k$ to compensate.
  \item Let $h_1^{k+1} = h_k + w$ and $s_{k+1} = s_k - wf_1$. Everything else stays the same:
  \item $r_{k+1} = r_k$ and $h_i^{k+1} = h_i^k$ for $i = 2\cdots n$.
  \item Then our inductive hypothesis remains true.
  \item $g = (h_1^k + w) f_1 + \cdots + h_n^k f_n + s^k - wf_1 + r^k$.
  \item $g = h_1^{k+1} f_1 + \cdots + h_n^{k+1} f_n + s^{k+1} + r^{k+1}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Conclusion of the division algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  Every term of $r^{k+1}$ is not divisible by any of the leading terms of $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ and
  \item \textbf{Claim.} The leading term of $s^{k+1}$ is less than the leading term of $s^k$ in the monomial ordering.
  \item \textbf{proof of claim.}  $s_{k+1} = s_k - wf_1 = s_k - wv + w(v - f_1)$.
  \item $wv = u = $ the leading term of $s_k$.
  \item Since $v$ is the leading term of $f_1$, all of the terms of $v -f_1$ are less than $v$ in the monomial ordering.
  \item So all of the terms of $w(v-f_1)$ are less than $wv = u$.
  \item To form $s_{k+1}$ we removed the leading term $u$ from $s_k$ and added in other terms that were all less than $u$.
  \item So all of the terms of $s_{k+1}$ are less than $u$. $\qed$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $I = (f_1, \cdots, f_n)$. Let $f$ be any polynomial
  \item Note that we have two different notions of ``remainder."
  \item The unique remainder theorem gives us a unique remainder $r$ such
  that no term of $r$ is in $\LT(I)$. Let's
  call this the ``true" remainder.
  \item The division algorithm gives us
  \item $f = h_1f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n + r$ where no term of $r$ is divisible
  by any of the leading terms of $f_1,\cdots,f_n$.
  \item If $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ is a Gr\"{o}bner basis then the remainder given by
  the division algorithm is the true remainder.
  \item But if $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ is not a Gr\"{o}bner Basis then the remainder given
  by the division algorithm is in general not meaningful, unless it is zero.

  \item (1) An algorithm for determining whether or not $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ is a Gr\"{o}bner Basis.
  \item (2) Given arbitrary $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ an algorithm for generating  $g_1,\cdots g_n$

\begin{frame}{Representations are not unique}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $I=(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ with $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ arbitrary. Let $g\in\R[x,y,z]$.
  \item There are unique $f,r$ such that $g=f+r$, $f\in I$, no term of $r$ is in $\LT(I)$.
  \item There are $h_1,\cdots,h_n$ such that $g=h_1f_1 + \cdots + h_nf_n + r$.
  \item But $h_1,\cdots h_n$ are \emph{not} unique.
  \item The element $f$ of the ideal is unique but the coefficients $h_i$ are not.
  \item This doesn't come up in $\R[x]$ since all ideals are principal.
  \item \textbf{Definition.} A \emph{representation} of $f$ in the basis $f_1,\cdots,f_n$
  is a linear combination $f=h_1 f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n$.

\begin{frame}{Challenging Representations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Definition.} A \emph{challenging representation} of $f$ in the basis
  $f_1,\cdots,f_n$ is a representation $f=h_1f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n$ such that
  \item the leading monomial of $f$ is not equal to the leading monomials of
  any of $h_1 f_1, \cdots h_n f_n$.
  \item \textbf{Example} $y = y(x^2y+1) -x(xy^2)$
  \item This is a challenging representation because the leading monomial of $y$ is not
  equal to the leading monomial of $y(x^2y+1)$ nor of $x(xy^2)$.
  \item A challenging representation can only occur when the leading terms
  of some of the $h_i f_i$ cancel with each other.
  \item The leading monomial of $f$ is necessarily equal to \emph{one of}
  the monomials of one of the $h_i f_i$.
  \item If there is no cancellation of leading terms then the leading monomial of $f$
  will be equal to the leading monomial of one of the $h_i f_i$.

  \item \textbf{proof.} Suppose $f=h_1 f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n$ is non-challenging.
  \item This means that the leading monomial of $f$ is equal to the leading monomial
  of $h_i f_i$ for some $i$.
  \item $\LM(h_i f_i) = \LM(h_i) \LM(f_i)$.

  \item \textbf{Example} $x^2y^3 - x^2 y^2 + y^2 = y^2(x^2y+1) -x(xy^2)$
  \item The leading monomial on the left-hand-side is $x^2y^3$.
  \item The leading monomials on the right-hand-side are $x^2y^3$ and $x^2y^2$.
  \item So this is a standard representation.
  \item A standard representation is non-challenging in a strong way.
  \item $f=h_1f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n$ is a standard representation iff the leading monomial of $f$ is $\geq$ the leading
  monomials of each of the nonzero $h_i f_i$ in monomial ordering.

\begin{frame}{Another Non-Challenging Example}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $f_1 = x^2y+1, f_2 = xy^2, f_3 = y + 1$.
  \item Let $f = xy +x + y$. Consider this representation.
  \item $xy +x + y = y(x^2y+1) -x(xy^2) + x(y +1)$.
  \item This is non-challenging, but non-standard.
  \item Suppose we want to challenge the fact that $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ is a
  Gr\"{o}bner Basis.
  \item To find a counter-example to Gr\"{o}bnerness, we want to start with a
  a function $f$ given by a challenging representation, because if $f$ is given
  by a non-challenging representation then it is manifestly a non-counterexample.
  \item Above $f$ is manifestly a non-counterexample to the Gr\"{o}bnerness of
  $f_1,f_2,f_3$.

\begin{frame}{Standard Representations and The Division Algorithm}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lemma.} Let $f, f_1,\cdots,f_n$ be polynomials.
  \item Suppose $f = h_1f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n + r$
  \item is the representation given by the division algorithm.
  \item Then the leading monomial of $f$ is $\geq$ the leading
  monomials of each of the nonzero $h_i f_i$ in monomial ordering.
  \item \textbf{Corrollary.} In the Lemma above, suppose $r=0$.
  \item Then $f = h_1f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n$ is a standard representation.
  \item \textbf{sketch of proof of Lemma.} In the division algorithm we first set $s=f$ and then we build
  up the $h_i$ by sequentially moving the terms $u$ out of $s$, starting with the leading term and moving on to smaller terms,
  and putting each $u$ into either $r$ or into one of the $h_i f_i$. So we never add any
  terms into $h_i$ that would cause the leading term of $h_i f_i$ t be greater than the leading term of $f$. $\qed$.

\begin{frame}{Characterizations of Gr\"{o}bnerness}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Theorem.} The following are equivalent:
  \item (a) $f_1,\cdots, f_n$ are a Gr\"{o}bner basis.
  \item (b) For all $f\in(f_1,\cdots, f_n)$ if $f = h_1f_1 + \cdots + h_n f_n + r$
  \item is the representation given by the division algorithm, then $r=0$.
  \item (c) For all $f\in(f_1,\cdots, f_n)$ there is a standard representation of $f$.
  \item (d) For all $f\in(f_1,\cdots, f_n)$ there is a non-challenging representation of $f$.
  \item \textbf{proof.} (a) $\Implies$ (b). Gr\"{o}bnerness gives us that $r$ is the
  true unique remainder from the unique remainder theorem. Since  $f\in(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$,
  $r=0$.
  \item (b)$\Implies$ (c) follows from previous slide. (c)$\Implies$ (d) trivial.
  (d)$\Implies$ (a) is the Claim four slides back. $\qed$
